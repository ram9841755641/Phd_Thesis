	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW:} {HIV} knowledge is based on subtype B, common in resource-rich settings, whereas globally non-B subtypes predominate. Inter-subtype pol diversity encompasses multiple genotypic differences among {HIV} variants, the consequence of which is unknown. This review summarizes publications from the past year relevant to the impact of {HIV} diversity on drug resistance evolution and its potential clinical implications.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS:} The benefit of antiretroviral therapy in non-B infected patients is ongoing, though subtype heterogeneity in rates of disease progression is observed. Pol inter-subtype diversity is high, and known subtype B drug resistance mutations occur in non-B subtypes. New mutations and subtype-specific mutation rates are identified, however, unexplained drug susceptibilities are seen, and additional insight is offered on structural pathogenic mechanisms of resistance in non-B subtypes. These differences may affect genotypic interpretation and our ability to apply drug resistance to patient care.
{SUMMARY:} Current evidence suggests good treatment response and comparable drug resistance evolution in {HIV-1} B and non-B infected patients, with increasingly emerging differences. Impact of inter-subtype diversity on drug susceptibility and on evolution of drug resistance should continue to be a major research focus to increase our understanding and ability to improve global patient care.},

	lccn = {0036},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To compare the prevalence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs and their interpretation in patients infected with non-B {HIV-1} variants versus {HIV-1subtype} B-infected patients with similar treatment regimens.
{METHODS:} The reverse transcriptase ({RT)} and protease genes of {HIV-1} were sequenced, and subtypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Each sequence belonging to a non-B variant was matched with a sequence belonging to subtype B. Patterns of resistance mutations were interpreted in terms of drug resistance using the {HIV} db algorithm.
{RESULTS:} {RT} mutations {M41L}, {L210W}, and, to a lesser extent, {T215Y} were less prevalent in patients infected with non-B variants. This lower prevalence was associated with subtypes A ({A1/A2)}, C, F ({F1/F2)}, and {CRF06\_cpx.} A lower prevalence of high-level resistance to zidovudine was also observed in patients infected with these {HIV-1} variants. In the protease gene, differences between patients infected with B or non-B strains were mainly observed for mutations playing a minor role in drug resistance and known to occur mainly as a natural polymorphism in non-B strains: {K20R/M/I}, {M36I}, {L63P}, {A71V/T}, and {V77I.} Interpretation of genotypes using the {HIV} db algorithm indicated that resistance to saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and amprenavir was more frequently a high-level resistance for subtype B and an intermediate-level resistance for non-B variants, but this difference was only significant for amprenavir.
{CONCLUSION:} Our results suggest that the genetic diversity of {HIV-1} does not play a major role in the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs.},

Combination antiviral therapies have provided clinical relief to some, but these treatments can have toxic sideeffects, and due to their expense these drugs have not yet been widely available in many of the countries worst affected by {AIDS.} Given the sudden appearance of {AIDS} in the 20th century, there is an obvious interest in understanding the origins and evolution of the causative viruses, not least in the context of attempts to prevent further such diseases (Hahn et al., 2000).},

However, {SIVcpz} strains from P. t. verus and P. t. vellerosus have not yet been identified. To better understand the epidemiology and natural history of {SIVcpz} among chimpanzees, we tested serum samples from 1415 chimpanzees housed at eight {U.S.} research centers and six zoos. Records indicated that 264 (18.6\%) of the chimpanzees were African-born. Subspecies identities for 161 chimpanzees, based on analysis of mitochondrial {DNA} sequences, were found to be P. t. troglodytes (n = 14), P. t. schweinfurthii (n = 3), P. t. verus (n = 143), and P. t. vellerosus (n = 1). All samples were screened for {HIV/SIV} antibodies by using an {HIV-1/2} peptide- based enzyme immunoassay ({EIA).} Reactive samples were tested further by Western blot ({WB).} Eight sera (0.57\%) were {EIA} reactive, but none was {HIV-1/2} {WB} positive. Two samples were {HIV-1} {WB} indeterminate. Both samples tested negative for {SIVcpz} and {HIV-1} sequences by reverse transcriptase {PCR}, suggesting an absence of infection. We also tested sera available from 8 male sexual partners, 6 offspring, and 12 cage mates of a known {SIVcpz-infected} chimpanzee. All samples were negative, suggesting that {SIVcpz} may not be easily transmitted to close contacts. Our data show that this large population of chimpanzees is not infected with {SIVcpz.} The absence of {SIVcpz} infection in P. t. verus suggests that {SIVcpz} may not be endemic to this subspecies and implies that {SIVcpz} may have been introduced more recently into the chimpanzee subspecies following divergence.},

Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of {HIV-1:} chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of {HIV-1} have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, {SIVs} are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, {SIV} and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of {SIVs} that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that {SIV} infection causes {CD4+} T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of {AIDS} is more ancient than the origin of {HIV-1.} Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses.},

The receptor binding surfaces of Env are in large part sterically occluded or conformationally masked prior to receptor binding. Knowledge of the unliganded, trimeric Env structure is key for an understanding of viral entry and immune escape, and for the design of vaccines to elicit neutralizing antibodies. We have used cryo-electron tomography and averaging to obtain the structure of the {SIV} Env complex prior to fusion. Our result reveals novel details of Env organisation, including tight interaction between monomers in the gp41 trimer, associated with a three-lobed, membrane-distal gp120 trimer. A cavity exists at the gp41-gp120 trimer interface. Our model for the spike structure agrees with previously predicted interactions between gp41 monomers, and furthers our understanding of gp120 interactions within an intact spike.},

	abstract = {Like all retroviruses, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ({HIV)} selectively packages two copies of its unspliced {RNA} genome, both of which are utilized for strand-transfer mediated recombination during reverse transcription – a process that enables rapid evolution under environmental and chemotherapeutic pressures. The viral {RNA} appears to be selected for packaging as a dimer, and there is evidence that dimerization and packaging are mechanistically coupled. Both processes are mediated by interactions between the nucleocapsid ({NC)} domains of a small number of assembling viral Gag polyproteins and {RNA} elements within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-{UTR)} of the genome. A number of secondary structures have been predicted for regions of the genome that are responsible for packaging, and high-resolution structures have been determined for a few small {RNA} fragments and protein-{RNA} complexes. However, major questions remain open regarding the {RNA} structures, and potentially the structural changes, that are responsible for dimeric genome selection. Here we review efforts that have been made to identify the molecular determinants and mechanism of {HIV-1} genome packaging.},

	abstract = {A detailed understanding of the morphology of the {HIV-1} envelope (Env) spike is key to understanding viral pathogenesis and for informed vaccine design. We have previously presented a cryoelectron microscopic tomogram ({cryoET)} of the Env spikes on {SIV} virions. Several structural features were noted in the gp120 head and gp41 stalk regions. Perhaps most notable was the presence of three splayed legs projecting obliquely from the base of the spike head toward the viral membrane. Subsequently, a second {3D} image of {SIV} spikes, also obtained by {cryoET}, was published by another group which featured a compact vertical stalk. We now report the {cryoET} analysis of {HIV-1} virion-associated Env spikes using enhanced analytical {cryoET} procedures. More than 2,000 Env spike volumes were initially selected, aligned, and sorted into structural classes using algorithms that compensate for the “missing wedge” and do not impose any symmetry. The results show varying morphologies between structural classes: some classes showed trimers in the head domains; nearly all showed two or three legs, though unambiguous three-fold symmetry was not observed either in the heads or the legs. Subsequently, clearer evidence of trimeric head domains and three splayed legs emerged when head and leg volumes were independently aligned and classified. These data show that {HIV-1}, like {SIV}, also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and, unexpectedly, shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. The tripod-like model for gp41 is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region., The envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of {HIV-1} and {SIV} virions facilitate target cell tropism, binding, and entry, and serve as the sole targets of humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity. X-ray crystallography has previously revealed the atomic structures of key core domains and peptides of the gp120 and gp41 Env spike subunits, but the manner by which these components are arranged in the Env spike is still speculative. Cryoelectron tomography ({cryoET)} affords a view of the entire Env spike in the context of the intact virion. We have previously published a {cryoET} model of the {SIV} Env spike which showed a unique tripod-like leg configuration for the solvent-exposed (external) gp41 stalk region. This model is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region. Subsequently another group using similar technology and virions reported a spike model displaying a compact gp41 stalk inconsistent with our splayed-leg spike model. In this report, we apply enhanced analytical {cryoET} procedures to show that {HIV-1} also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. These results have implications for the design of effective vaccines targeting this region and may provide new insights into Env spike function.},

	abstract = {By using a retroviral construct derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus and capable of expressing the dominant selectable neo gene, we measured the effects of moving or deleting a sequence (psi) known to be required in cis for the packaging of genomic {RNA} into virus particles. When psi was at its wild-type position (in {SVX} virus) near the 5' end of the {RNA}, the titer of infectious virus production was 5 X 10(6) G-418-resistant {CFU} per ml. The titer was decreased approximately fivefold when psi was moved, in its proper orientation, to near the 3' end of the virus ({SVX-psi} C) and was decreased approximately 600-fold when psi was moved, in its proper orientation, into the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. When psi was deleted ({SVX-psi-)} or inserted in the opposite orientation at either of these two positions, the titer was decreased by 3000-fold relative to {SVX.} In {SVX-psi} C, psi was no longer in the intron (as it is in {SVX} and Moloney murine leukemia virus) but was moved to a region which is only exonic. This resulted in the encapsidation of both spliced and unspliced {RNAs}, their efficient reverse transcription, and their integration into the genome of an infected cell. A number of proviruses resulting from integration of either spliced or unspliced {RNAs} were cloned. Four of these clones were subjected to sequence analysis in the region of the splice sites, and it was determined which sites are used by these viruses and also which are used by Moloney murine leukemia virus.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the leader region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} {RNA} to decipher the nature of the cis-acting E/psi element required for encapsidation of viral {RNA} into virus particles. Our data indicate that, for {RNA} encapsidation, there are at least two functional subregions in the leader region. One subregion is located at a position immediately proximal to the major splice donor, and the second is located between the splice donor and the beginning of the gag gene. This suggests that at least two discrete cis-acting elements are recognition signals for encapsidation. To determine whether specific putative {RNA} secondary structures serve as the signal(s) for encapsidation, we constructed primary base substitution mutations that would be expected to destabilize these potential structures and second-site compensatory mutations that would restore secondary structure. Analysis of these mutants allowed the identification of two discrete hairpins that facilitate {RNA} encapsidation in vivo. Thus, the {HIV-1} E/psi region is a multipartite element composed of specific and functional {RNA} secondary structures. Compensation of the primary mutations by the second-site mutations could not be attained in trans. This indicates that interstrand base pairing between these two stem regions within the hairpins does not appear to be the basis for {HIV-1} {RNA} dimer formation. Comparison of the hypothetical {RNA} secondary structures from 10 replication-competent {HIV-1} strains suggests that a subset of the hydrogen-bonded base pairs within the stems of the hairpins is likely to be required for function in cis.},

	abstract = {The 5′-untranslated region (5′-{UTR)} of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 ({HIV-1)} genome regulates multiple {RNA-dependent} functions during viral replication and has been proposed to adopt multiple secondary structures. Recent phylogenetic studies identified base pair complementarity between residues of the unique 5′ element and those near the gag start codon ({gagAUG)} that is conserved among evolutionarily distant retroviruses, suggesting a potential long-range {RNA-RNA} interaction. However, nucleotide accessibility studies led to conflicting conclusions about the presence of such interactions in virions and in infected cells. Here we show that an 11-nucleotide oligo-{RNA} spanning residues 105-115 of the 5′-{UTR} (U5) readily binds to oligoribonucleotides containing the gag start codon ({AUG)}, disrupting a pre-existing stem loop and forming a heteroduplex stabilized by 11 Watson Crick base pairs (Kd = 0.47 ± 0.16 {μM).} Addition of the {HIV-1} nucleocapsid protein ({NC)}, the transacting viral factor required for genome packaging, disrupts the heteroduplex by binding tightly to U5 (Kd = 122 ± 10 {nM).} The structure of the {NC:U5} complex, determined by {NMR}, exhibits features similar to those observed in {NC} complexes with {HIV-1} stem loop {RNAs}, including the insertion of guanosine nucleobases to hydrophobic clefts on the surface of the zinc fingers and a 3′-to-5′ orientation of the {RNA} relative to protein. Our findings indicate that the previously proposed long-range U5-{gagAUG} interaction is feasible, and suggest a potential {NC-dependent} mechanism for modulating the structure of the 5′-{UTR.}},

	abstract = {The {MN} strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 was grown in H9 cells, concentrated by centrifugation, and disrupted, and proteins were purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Complete amino acid sequences were determined for the mature Gag proteins, showing natural proteolytic cleavage sites and the order of proteins (p17-p24-p2-p7-p1-p6) in the Gag precursors. At least two sequence variants of p24 and eight sequence variants of p17 were detected. The two most abundant variants of p24 and p17 represented at least 50\% +/- 5\% and 20\% +/- 5\% of their totals, respectively. These data suggest heterogeneity in the virus population, with 50\% of the total virus containing the most abundant forms of p17 and p24 and 20\% of the virus containing the second most abundant forms. The Gag precursors of these suggested viruses differ from each other by only 3 amino acid residues but differ from the precursors predicted by the published {MN} proviral {DNA} sequence by 10 residues. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the purified p24 forms showed that the measured molecular weight of the protein was 200 +/- 50 atomic mass units greater than the calculated molecular weight. The source of additional mass for the p24 forms was not determined, but the observation is consistent with previous suggestions that the protein is phosphorylated. Greater than 98\% of the total recovered p17 was myristylated at the N-terminal glycine residue, and the measured molecular weights (as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) of the most abundant forms were within 3 atomic mass units of the calculated molecular weights (15,266).},

	abstract = {Background: The gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein of {HIV-1} binds sequentially to {CD4} and chemokine receptors on cells to initiate virus entry. During natural infection, gp120 is a primary target of the humoral immune response, and it has evolved to resist antibody-mediated neutralization. We previously reported the structure at 2.5 Å of a gp120 core from the {HXBc2} laboratory-adapted isolate in complex with a 2 domain fragment of {CD4} and the antigen binding fragment of a human antibody. This revealed atomic details of gp120-receptor interactions and suggested multiple mechanisms of immune evasion. Results: We have now extended the {HXBc2} structure in P2221 crystals to 2.2 Å. The enhanced resolution enabled a more accurate modeling of less-well-ordered regions and provided conclusive identification of the density in the central cavity at the crux of the gp120-{CD4} interaction as isopropanol from the crystallization medium. We have also determined the structure of a gp120 core from the primary clinical {HIV-1} isolate, {YU2}, in the same ternary complex but in a C2 crystal lattice. Comparisons of {HXBc2} and {YU2} showed that while {CD4} binding was rigid, portions of the gp120 core were conformationally flexible; overall differences were minor, with sequence changes concentrated on a surface expected to be exposed on the envelope oligomer. Conclusions: Despite dramatic antigenic differences between primary and laboratory-adapted {HIV-1}, the gp120 cores from these isolates are remarkably similar. Taken together with chimeric substitution and sequence analysis, this indicates that neutralization resistance is specified by quaternary interactions involving the major variable loops and thus affords a mechanism for viral adaptation. Conservation of the central cavity suggests the possibility of therapeutic inhibitors. The structures reported here extend in detail and generality our understanding of the biology of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein.},

It is the main driving force for the generation of drug resistance and the escape from immune surveillance. G to A hypermutation is one of the characteristics of primate lentiviruses, as well as other retroviruses, during replication in vivo and in cell culture. The molecular mechanisms of this process, however, remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that {CEM15} (also known as apolipoprotein B {mRNA} editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like {3G;} {APOBEC3G)}, an endogenous inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} replication, is a cytidine deaminase and is able to induce G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral {DNA.} This effect can be counteracted by the {HIV-1} virion infectivity factor (Vif). It seems that this viral {DNA} mutator is a viral defence mechanism in host cells that may induce either lethal hypermutation or instability of the incoming nascent viral reverse transcripts, which could account for the Vif-defective phenotype. Importantly, the accumulation of {CEM15-mediated} non-lethal hypermutation in the replicating viral genome could potently contribute to the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations.},

The Vif (virion infectivity factor) proteins are encoded by primate immunodeficiency viruses, most notably human immunodeficiency virus-1 ({HIV-1).} These proteins are potent regulators of virus infection and replication and are consequently essential for pathogenic infections in vivo. {HIV-1} Vif seems to be required during the late stages of virus production for the suppression of an innate antiviral phenotype that resides in human T lymphocytes. Thus, in the absence of Vif, expression of this phenotype renders progeny virions non-infectious. Here, we describe a unique cellular gene, {CEM15}, whose transient or stable expression in cells that do not normally express {CEM15} recreates this phenotype, but whose antiviral action is overcome by the presence of Vif. Because the {Vif:CEM15} regulatory circuit is critical for {HIV-1} replication, perturbing the circuit may be a promising target for future {HIV/AIDS} therapies.},

To test this hypothesis, we produced pseudotyped wild-type and vif-deleted {HIV} gpt virions (which contain the {HIV-1} genome with the bacterial mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt in place of the viral env gene) in permissive cells, and we used them to generate nonpermissive H9 leukemic T cells that express these proviruses. We then fused these H9 cells with permissive {HeLa} cells that express the {HIV-1} envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41, and we asked whether the heterokaryons would release infectious {HIV} gpt virions. The results clearly showed that the vif-deleted virions released by the heterokaryons were noninfectious whereas the wild-type virions were highly infectious. This strongly suggests that nonpermissive cells, the natural targets of {HIV-1}, contain a potent endogenous inhibitor of {HIV-1} replication that is overcome by Vif.},

Vif was required at the stage of viral particle formation, for cell-to-cell as well as for cell-free transmission of {HIV-1.} Accordingly, vif-defective viruses could be complemented by the expression of vif in the producer but not in the target cell. vif-defective virions contained wild-type amounts of Gag and Env proteins, reverse transcriptase, integrase, genomic {RNA}, and partial reverse transcripts.

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} vpugene encodes a type I anchored integral membrane phosphoprotein with two independent functions. First, it regulates virus release from a post-endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} compartment by an ion channel activity mediated by its transmembrane anchor. Second, it induces the selective down regulation of host cell receptor proteins ({CD4} and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules) in a process involving its phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail. In the present work, we show that the Vpu-induced proteolysis of nascent {CD4} can be completely blocked by peptide aldehydes that act as competitive inhibitors of proteasome function and also by lactacystin, which blocks proteasome activity by covalently binding to the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes. The sensitivity of Vpu-induced {CD4} degradation to proteasome inhibitors paralleled the inhibition of proteasome degradation of a model ubiquitinated substrate. Characterization of {CD4-associated} oligosaccharides indicated that {CD4} rescued from Vpu-induced degradation by proteasome inhibitors is exported from the {ER} to the Golgi complex. This finding suggests that retranslocation of {CD4} from the {ER} to the cytosol may be coupled to its proteasomal degradation. {CD4} degradation mediated by Vpu does not require the {ER} chaperone calnexin and is dependent on an intact ubiquitin-conjugating system. This was demonstrated by inhibition of {CD4} degradation (i) in cells expressing a thermally inactivated form of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 or (ii) following expression of a mutant form of ubiquitin (Lys48 mutated to Arg48) known to compromise ubiquitin targeting by interfering with the formation of polyubiquitin complexes. {CD4} degradation was also prevented by altering the four Lys residues in its cytosolic domain to Arg, suggesting a role for ubiquitination of one or more of these residues in the process of degradation. The results clearly demonstrate a role for the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the process of Vpu-induced {CD4} degradation. In contrast to other viral proteins (human cytomegalovirus {US2} and {US11)}, however, whose translocation of host {ER} molecules into the cytosol occurs in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, Vpu-targeted {CD4} remains in the {ER} in a transport-competent form when proteasome activity is blocked.},

In cycling cells, progression from G2 to M phase is driven by activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex, an event caused, in part, by dephosphorylation of two regulatory amino acids of p34cdc2 (Thr-14 and Tyr-15). We show here that Vpr arrests the cell cycle in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex. Vpr expression in cells caused p34cdc2 to remain in the phosphorylated, inactive state, p34cdc2/cyclin B complexes immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Vpr were almost completely inactive in a histone H1 kinase assay. Coexpression of a constitutively active mutant p34cdc2 molecule with Vpr relieved the G2 arrest. These findings strongly suggest that Vpr arrests cells in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex that is required for entry into M phase. In vivo, Vpr might, by preventing p34cdc2 activation, delay or prevent apoptosis of infected cells. This would increase the amount of virus each infected cell produced.},

Unlike the other lentivirus regulatory proteins, Vpr is present in virions at relatively high copy number. In cells, Vpr is localized to the nucleus. Possible functions for vpr consistent with these findings include the nuclear import of preintegration complexes, transactivation of cellular genes, or induction of cellular differentiation. We show here, using both replication competent, macrophage-tropic virus and a sensitive, single-cycle luciferase {HIV-1} reporter vector, that vpr is important for efficient viral replication in primary monocyte/macrophages, but appears to play no role in activated or resting T cell infection. The block to infection in monocytes was localized by {PCR} analysis of newly synthesized viral {DNA} and with the luciferase reporter vector to a stage in the viral life cycle after entry and reverse transcription, yet prior to, or at the time of, proviral transcription. In addition, infection of mononuclear phagocytes with virions that had been loaded with Vpr molecules in the producer cells by trans-complementation still showed a vpr-phenotype. These data suggest a role for vpr molecules produced in newly infected cells, in addition to its presumed function in the virion.},

The requirement for Nef during viral biogenesis particles suggests that Nef might play a role in this process. Alternatively, because Nef is incorporated into viruses, it might play a role when progeny virions reach target cells. We challenged these hypotheses by manipulating the amounts of Nef incorporated in viruses while keeping its expression level constant in producer cells. This was achieved by forcing the incorporation of Nef into viral particles by fusing a Vpr sequence to the C-terminal end of Nef. A cleavage site for the viral protease was introduced between Nef and Vpr to allow the release of Nef fragments from the fusion protein during virus maturation. We show that the resulting Nef-{CS-Vpr} fusion partially retains the ability of Nef to downregulate cell surface {CD4} and that high amounts of Nef-{CS-Vpr} are incorporated into viral particles compared with what is seen for wild-type Nef. The fusion protein is processed during virion maturation and releases Nef fragments similar to those found in viruses produced in the presence of wild-type Nef. Unlike viruses produced in the presence of wild-type Nef, viruses produced in the presence of Nef-{CS-Vpr} do not have an increase in infectivity and are as poorly infectious as viruses produced in the absence of Nef. These findings demonstrate that the presence of Nef in viral particles is not sufficient to increase human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity and suggest that Nef plays a role during the biogenesis of viral particles.},

Nef-mediated down-modulation of {HLA} class I on infected cells can confer resistance to {CTL} clearance, but the factors determining the efficiency of this process are unknown. This study examines the impact of Nef on the antiviral activity of several {CTL} clones recognizing epitopes from early and late {HIV-1} proteins, restricted by {HLA-A}, -B, and -C molecules. {CTL-targeting} epitopes in early proteins remained susceptible to the effects of Nef, although possibly to a lesser degree than {CTL-targeting} late protein epitopes, indicating that significant Nef-mediated {HLA} down-regulation can precede even the presentation of early protein-derived epitopes. However, {HLA-C–restricted} {CTLs} were unaffected by Nef, consistent with down-regulation of cell-surface {HLA-A} and -B but not {HLA-C} molecules. Thus, {CTLs} vary dramatically in their susceptibility to Nef interference, suggesting differences in the relative importance of {HLA-A–} and {HLA-B–} versus {HLA-C–restricted} {CTLs} in vivo. The data thus indicate that {HLA-C–restricted} {CTLs} may have an under-appreciated antiviral role in the setting of Nef in vivo and suggest a benefit of promoting {HLA-C–restricted} {CTLs} for immunotherapy or vaccine development.},

We confirmed this effect by using a nef-mutant {HIV-1} strain ({NL-M20A)} that expresses a Nef protein which does not induce down-regulation of {HLA} class I molecules but is otherwise functional. {HIV-1-specific} {CTL} clones were not able to kill primary {CD4+} T cells infected with a Nef-positive {HIV-1} strain ({NL-432)} but efficiently lysed {CD4+} T cells infected with {NL-M20A.} Interestingly, {CTL} clones stimulated with {NL-432-infected} {CD4+} T cells were able to produce cytokines, albeit at a lower level than when stimulated with {NL-M20A-infected} {CD4+} T cells. This indicates that Nef-mediated {HLA} class I down-regulation affects {CTL} cytokine production to a lesser extent than cytolytic activity. Replication of {NL-432} was partially suppressed in a coculture of {HIV-1-infected} {CD4+} T cells and {HIV-1-specific} {CTL} clones, while replication of {NL-M20A} was completely suppressed. These results suggest that {HIV-1-specific} {CD8+} T cells are able to partially suppress the replication of {HIV-1} through production of soluble {HIV-1-suppressive} factors such as chemokines and gamma interferon.

How Nef accomplishes the balance between such conflicting selective pressures remains elusive. By genetic and functional studies, we found that {Arg75Thr} and {Tyr85Phe} mutations, located in a well-conserved proline-rich region in Nef, were differently associated with escape from {CTL} responses specific for two overlapping {HLA-B35-restricted} epitopes. {CTLs} specific for an epitope, that selected {Tyr85Phe}, were elicited earlier and had more potent functional avidities than did those that selected {Arg75Thr.} Although the double mutant could escape from both {CTLs}, the mutations are rarely observed in combination naturally. Introduction of both mutations reduced Nef’s {HLA} class I down-regulation activity and increased the susceptibility of virus-infected cells to recognition by {CTLs} targeting other epitopes. Moreover, the mutant Nef was impaired in the association with activated cellular kinases and in the enhancement of viral replication. These results highlight {CTL} immunosurveillance as important modulators of Nef’s biological activity in the infected host.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} induces strong responses from human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen ({HLA)} class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes ({CTL).} In a previous report we identified an immunodominant region (amino acids 73-144) in the {NEF} protein that was recognized by {CD8+} class I-restricted {CTL} of most asymptomatic individuals. Analysis of the 73-144 region by peptide sensitization, experiments using overlapping peptides corresponding to the {LAI} isolate identified the peptide sequences located between residues 73 and 82 or 84 and 92 and the peptide sequence between residues 134 and 144 as cognate peptides for {HLA-A11-} and {HLA-B18-restricted} epitopes, respectively. This report describes the variable demonstrable reactivities of {CTL} obtained from {HLA-A11} or {HLA-B18} seropositive, asymptomatic patients who all had a response to the virus {NEF} protein, but who did not always recognize appropriate cognate peptides. The high mutation rate of {HIV} probably facilitates the selection of mutants that can avoid the cellular immune response. We therefore analyzed the variability of these epitopes restricted by {HLA-A11} and {HLA-B18.} We sequenced several viral isolates from {HLA-A11} and {HLA-B18} donors who recognized certain {HLA-peptide} complexes and from those who did not. A {CTL} sensitization assay was used to show that some mutations led to a great reduction in {CTL} activity in vitro. This might be due to failure of the mutated epitope to bind major histocompatibility complex class I molecule. A simple assay was used to detect peptides that promoted the assembly of class I molecules. Some of these mutations at major anchor positions prevented {HLA-A11/peptide} binding, and consequently impaired recognition of the {HLA-peptide} complex by the T cell receptor.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Human immunodeficiency virus-1 ({HIV-1)} infection decreases the cell-surface expression of its cellular receptor, {CD4}, through the combined actions of Nef, Env and Vpu. Such functional convergence strongly suggests that {CD4} downregulation is critical for optimal viral replication, yet the significance of this phenomenon has so far remained a puzzle.
{RESULTS:} We show that high levels of {CD4} on the surface of {HIV-infected} cells induce a dramatic reduction in the infectivity of released virions by the sequestering of the viral envelope by {CD4.} {CD4} is able to accumulate in viral particles while at the same time blocking incorporation of Env into the virion. Nef and Vpu, through their ability to downregulate {CD4}, counteract this effect.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The {CD4-mediated} 'envelope interference' described here probably explains the plurality of mechanisms developed by {HIV} to downregulate the cell-surface expression of its receptor.},

Deletion mutants corresponding to 86 and 35 N-terminal residues of the Nef protein were prepared. The {GST-Nef} constructs were used to identify cellular kinases capable of interacting with Nef. After incubation with a Jurkat cell lysate, the {GST-Nef} constructs immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads bound to cellular kinase(s) and were phosphorylated at three sites in vitro: one on threonine at position 15, one on serine between residues 1 and 35, and one on threonine between residues 36 and 86. The Nef-phosphorylating activity was inhibited by protein kinase C ({PKC)-selective} inhibitors. Cell fractionation showed that this Nef-binding kinase was mainly in the membrane-associated fraction. These results suggest that kinase(s) of the {PKC} family are specifically bound to and phosphorylate Nef in vitro. The interaction of Nef with cellular kinases and its phosphorylation may be important in mediating the effects of Nef in {HIV-1} pathogenesis.},

To reconcile these observations, we expressed a hybrid {CD8-Nef} protein in Jurkat cells. Two opposite phenotypes were found, which depended on the intracellular localization of Nef. Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface, the chimera inhibited or activated early signaling events from the T cell antigen receptor. Activated Jurkat cells died by apoptosis, and only cells with mutated nef genes expressing truncated Nefs survived, which rendered Nef nonfunctional. These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro. Not only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation, but they also explain effects of Nef in {HIV} infection and progression to {AIDS.}},

The recently reported association of Nef with an unidentified serine kinase provides a clue as to how Nef might exert its effects. Considering the key role of protein kinase C ({PKC)} in T cell activation, we investigated the possibility that Nef interacts with {PKC.} Our results, using two approaches for detecting interactions between Nef and {PKC} isozymes in Jurkat cells, show that Nef interacts preferentially with {θPKC.} The interaction of Nef and {θPKC} is independent of calcium, enhanced by phospholipid activators of {PKC} and not affected by a {PKC} pseudosubstrate peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing Nef fails to produce the usual translocation of {θPKC} from the cytosol to the particulate fraction; translocation of {βPKC} and {ϵPKC} was unaffected. Indeed, there appears to be a net loss of {θPKC} in Nef-expressing cells following stimulation. The loss of {θPKC}, which may be a result of inhibition of its binding to {RACKs} due to Nef binding, could contribute to the various impairments of T cell function associated with {HIV} infection and Nef expression.},

By comparing nef-competent and nef-deleted {HIV-1} strains in an in vitro coculture system, we demonstrate that the presence of this viral accessory gene leads to impairment of the ability of {HIV-1-specific} {CTL} clones to suppress viral replication. Furthermore, inhibition by genetically modified {CTL} that do not require major histocompatibility complex class I-presented antigen (expressing the {CD4} T-cell receptor [{TCR]} ζ-chain hybrid receptor) is similar for both nef-competent and -deleted strains, indicating that Nef does not impair the effector functions of {CTL} but acts at the level of {TCR} triggering. In contrast, we note that another accessory gene, vpr, does not induce resistance of {HIV-1} to suppression by {CTL} clones. We conclude that Nef (and not Vpr) contributes to functional {HIV-1} immune evasion and that this effect is mediated by diminished antigen presentation to {CTL.}},

The synaptic complex is inactivated by strand transfer inhibitors ({STI)} with {IC50} values of ∼ 20 {nM} for inhibition of concerted integration. We detected a new nucleoprotein complex on a native agarose gel that was produced in the presence of \&gt; 200 {nM} {STI}, termed the {IN–single} {DNA} ({ISD)} complex. Two {IN} dimers appear to bind in a parallel fashion at the {DNA} terminus, producing an ∼ 32-bp {DNase} I protective footprint. In the presence of raltegravir ({RAL)}, {MK-2048}, and L-841,411, {IN} incorporated ∼ 20–25\% of the input blunt-ended {DNA} substrate into the stabilized {ISD} complex. Seven other {STI} also produced the {ISD} complex (≤ 5\% of input {DNA).} The formation of the {ISD} complex was not dependent on {3′OH} processing, and the {DNA} was predominantly blunt ended in the complex. The {RAL-resistant} {IN} mutant {N155H} weakly forms the {ISD} complex in the presence of {RAL} at ∼ 25\% level of wild-type {IN.} In contrast, {MK-2048} and L-841,411 produced ∼ 3-fold to 5-fold more {ISD} than {RAL} with {N155H} {IN}, which is susceptible to these two inhibitors. The results suggest that {STI} are slow-binding inhibitors and that the potency to form and stabilize the {ISD} complex is not always related to inhibition of concerted integration. Rather, the apparent binding and dissociation properties of each {STI} influenced the production of the {ISD} complex.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} entry into target cells involves sequential binding of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein to {CD4} and to specific chemokine receptors. Soluble {CD4} ({sCD4)} is thought to mimic membrane-anchored {CD4}, and its binding alters the conformation of the {HIV-1} envelope glycoproteins. Two cross-competing monoclonal antibodies, 17b and {CG10}, that recognize {CD4-inducible} gp120 epitopes and that block gp120-chemokine receptor binding were used to investigate the nature and functional significance of gp120 conformational changes initiated by {CD4} binding. Envelope glycoproteins derived from both T-cell line-adapted and primary {HIV-1} isolates exhibited increased binding of the 17b antibody in the presence of {sCD4.} {CD4-induced} exposure of the 17b epitope on the oligomeric envelope glycoprotein complex occurred over a wide range of temperatures and involved movement of the gp120 {V1/V2} variable loops. Amino acid changes that reduced the efficiency of 17b epitope exposure following {CD4} binding invariably compromised the ability of the {HIV-1} envelope glycoproteins to form syncytia or to support virus entry. Comparison of the {CD4} dependence and neutralization efficiencies of the 17b and {CG10} antibodies suggested that the epitopes for these antibodies are minimally accessible following attachment of gp120 to cell surface {CD4.} These results underscore the functional importance of these {CD4-induced} changes in gp120 conformation and illustrate viral strategies for sequestering chemokine receptor-binding regions from the humoral immune response.},

To track the behavior of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)-1} in the cytoplasm of infected cells, we have tagged virions by incorporation of {HIV} Vpr fused to the {GFP.} Observation of the {GFP-labeled} particles in living cells revealed that they moved in curvilinear paths in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region, often near the microtubule-organizing center. Further studies show that {HIV} uses cytoplasmic dynein and the microtubule network to migrate toward the nucleus. By combining {GFP} fused to the {NH2} terminus of {HIV-1} Vpr tagging with other labeling techniques, it was possible to determine the state of progression of individual particles through the viral life cycle. Correlation of immunofluorescent and electron micrographs allowed high resolution imaging of microtubule-associated structures that are proposed to be reverse transcription complexes. Based on these observations, we propose that {HIV} uses dynein and the microtubule network to facilitate the delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus of the cell during early postentry steps of the {HIV} life cycle.},

	abstract = {Endogenous reverse transcription ({ERT)} of retroviruses has long been considered a somewhat artificial process which only mimics reverse transcription occurring in target cells, as detergents or amphipathic peptides have classically been used to make the envelopes of retroviruses in these reaction systems permeable. Recently, several studies suggested that {ERT} of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} might occur without detergent treatment. However, this phenomenon could be due to damage of the retroviral envelope during the process of virion purification or freezing and thawing. In this report, intravirion {HIV-1} {ERT}, without detergent-induced permeabilization, is demonstrated to occur in the natural microenvironments of {HIV-1} virions and is not caused by artificial processes. Therefore, this stage of the viral life cycle was termed natural {ERT} ({NERT).} The efficiency of {NERT} in {HIV-1} virions was markedly augmented by several physiological substances in the extracellular milieu, such as polyamines and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. In addition, {HIV-1} virions in seminal plasma samples harbored dramatically higher levels of full-length or nearly full-length reverse transcripts than virions isolated from peripheral blood plasma samples of {HIV-1-seropositive} men. When {HIV-1} virions were incubated with seminal plasma samples, infectivity in initially nondividing cells was also significantly enhanced. Thus, we suggest that {HIV-1} virions are actively altered by the extracellular microenvironment and that {NERT} may play an important role in viral infection of nondividing cells.},

Virion morphogenesis can be divided into three stages: assembly, wherein the virion is created and essential components are packaged; budding, wherein the virion crosses the plasma membrane and obtains its lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the virion changes structure and becomes infectious. All of these stages are coordinated by the Gag polyprotein and its proteolytic maturation products, which function as the major structural proteins of the virus. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of {HIV-1} assembly, budding, and maturation, starting with a general overview and then providing detailed descriptions of each of the different stages of virion morphogenesis.},

This chapter focuses on the concept of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV‐1)} {RNA} packaging. {RNA} encapsidation by retroviruses is a remarkable process by which the virus negotiates the trafﬁcking of a minority species of {mRNA} through a particular cellular pathway to become its genome. During this, in the case of {HIV}, it may ﬁrst be translated before being selected by the viral Gag protein, highly speciﬁcally, from the cellular background pool of {mRNAs.} These processes involve the recognition of {RNA} secondary and tertiary structures and an {RNA–RNA} intermolecular interaction to package a diploid dimeric {RNA} genome. {RNA} transport and encapsidation involves cellular chaper-one proteins of which, as yet, few are identiﬁed. The structural detail of the interaction between the viral {RNA} and the Gag protein is described in the chapter. This process requires ﬂexibility and conformational change in the {RNA} and reﬂects the fact that transport from transcriptional site to virion likely involves the genomic {RNA} adopting a number of different structures to display the relevant stage‐speciﬁc cis‐acting signals. The speciﬁcity of this process and the virus‐speciﬁc nature of {RNA} export from a cell make these processes attractive therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Transfer of the {RNA} genome of a retrovirus from one cell to another requires its assembly within the structure of an infectious virion. Although most of the components of the retroviral particle have been identified (see Fig. 1 and Chapter 2), the molecular details of the assembly mechanisms are poorly understood. This may seem surprising since the number of distinct proteins contained in a retrovirus is small. What makes the process of assembly both difficult and interesting to study is its highly dynamic nature. An examination of the mature retroviral particle cannot fully explain the steps in assembly because these components are not those from which the particle was made. Rather, all of the structural proteins of the virion, with few exceptions, are derived from three polyproteins: Gag, Gag-Pro-Pol, and Env (Fig. 2). Each of these precursor proteins has special characteristics needed for specific steps in the assembly process, and each undergoes extensive changes along the way. In brief, the surface ({SU)} and transmembrane ({TM)} proteins found on the surface of the virion are initially synthesized as a single polypeptide, the Env glycoprotein, which is assembled into oligomeric complexes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum ({RER)}, extensively modified, and then cleaved by a cell-encoded protease during transport to the surface of the cell. In some instances, further proteolytic processing of {TM} occurs after the particle is released. Likewise, the proteins found on the inside the virion (matrix, {MA;} capsid, {CA;} nucleocapsid, {NC;} protease, {PR;} reverse transcriptase, {RT;} integrase, {IN)} are initially linked within the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol proteins. The Gag protein is sufficient for directing budding at the plasma membrane, and the Pro-Pol polyproteins are incorporated into the resulting particle because they are linked to Gag. Subsequent cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol proteins by the viral protease brings about new shapes and arrangements inside the nascent virion as the immature particle undergoes a metamorphosis into the mature, infectious retrovirus. Even the structure of the viral {RNA}, packaged into the virion through an interaction with Gag, changes during the budding and maturation process.},

Proteolysis of its main structural component, Gag, is required for morphological maturation and infectivity and leads to release of four functional domains and the spacer peptides {SP1} and {SP2.} The N-terminal cleavages of Gag and the separation of {SP1} from {CA} are all essential for viral infectivity, while the roles of the two C-terminal cleavages and the role of {SP2}, separating the {NC} and p6 domains, are less well defined. We have analyzed {HIV-1} variants with defective cleavage at either or both sites flanking {SP2}, or largely lacking {SP2}, regarding virus production, infectivity, and structural maturation. Neither the presence nor the proteolytic processing of {SP2} was required for particle release. Viral infectivity was almost abolished when both cleavage sites were defective and severely reduced when the fast cleavage site between {SP2} and p6 was defective. This correlated with an increased proportion of irregular core structures observed by cryo-electron tomography, although processing of {CA} was unaffected. Mutation of the slow cleavage site between {NC} and {SP2} or deletion of most of {SP2} had only a minor effect on infectivity and did not induce major alterations in mature core morphology. We speculate that not only separation of {NC} and p6 but also the processing kinetics in this region are essential for successful maturation, while {SP2} itself is dispensable.},

In the last years, however, the {HIV-1} transmission rate among heterosexuals has dramatically increased, becoming the prevalent transmission route. In fact, while the traditional risk groups have high levels of knowledge and avoid high-risk practices, the heterosexuals do not sufficiently perceive the risk of {HIV-1} infection. This misperception, linked to the growing number of immigrants from non-Western Countries, where non-B clades and circulating recombinant forms ({CRFs)} are prevalent, is progressively introducing {HIV-1} variants of non-B subtype in the Italian epidemic. This is in agreement with reports from other Western European Countries.},

	abstract = {{DNA} sequences encoding the surface envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} and type 2 ({HIV-2)} were amplified by {PCR} from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with serologically defined {HIV-1/HIV-2} mixed infections from Bombay, India. {HIV-1-specific} {PCR} products were obtained in seven of seven randomly chosen doubly reactive cases, while {HIV-2-specific} sequences were detected in five of seven cases (71\%). {DNA} sequence analysis showed that the {HIV-1} gp120 coding sequences were closely related to each other (nucleotide sequence divergence of between 3.1 and 6.8\%). Phylogenetic tree analysis placed the Indian strains within the C subtype of {HIV-1}, being most similar to sequences previously found in East and South Africa. The {HIV-2} sequences were also closely related to each other, with an overall sequence divergence of between 5.6 and 10.5\%. The low level of nucleotide divergence among Indian {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} sequences suggests a fairly recent introduction of each virus into this population from a single point of entry in each case. The {HIV-2} sequences reported here represent the first analysis of Asian {HIV-2} strains and confirm the serological pattern previously detected in India. These data show that a substantial spread of {HIV-2}, together with {HIV-1}, has appeared outside Africa in a population hitherto unexposed to {HIV.} These findings imply that further spread of {HIV-2} worldwide is to be expected and have important implications for future vaccine and therapy development.},

The assay has a lower limit of detection of 100 {copies/mL} and is linear over 4 logs. {HIV-2} viral {RNA} was detectable in 56\% of all samples tested; the median load was 141 {copies/mL.} Levels of viral {RNA} in the plasma were inversely related to {CD4+} cell counts. {HIV-2} and {HIV-1} viral loads were compared among the seroincident women in the cohort; the median viral load was {30X} lower in the {HIV-2-infected} women (P{\textless} .001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), irrespective of the length of time infected.

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that cross-species transmission events have been quite frequent. Both {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} appear to have resulted from multiple transfers of lentiviruses naturally infecting other primates; the source of {HIV-2} appears to have been sooty mangabeys, whereas for {HIV-1} the source may have been chimpanzees. Phylogenetic analyses also provide evidence that recombination has occurred between divergent viruses in vivo. Evolutionary trees based on various regions of the viral genome generally have consistent branching orders. However, some isolates fall into significantly different phylogenetic positions, indicating that their genomes are mosaics of sequences with different evolutionary histories. This implies that co-infection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in {HIV-infected} humans and {SIV-infected} primates; this could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties, and also has important implications for {HIV} vaccine development programmes.},

A characteristic feature of this virus is its genomic heterogeneity, which occurs to varying degrees in different viral isolates. To define further the nature and extent of these genomic changes, we compared the molecularly cloned genomes of two variant {HTLV-III} isolates by extensive restriction enzyme mapping and heteroduplex thermal melt analysis. Both viral isolates were found to be highly related to each other throughout their entire genomic complement, yet they differed markedly in their restriction enzyme maps. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis revealed several distinct regions of divergence located almost exclusively in the part of the genome that encodes the viral envelope gene. In vitro culture of one of these viruses over a period of 3 months did not result in any genomic changes as determined by restriction analysis of viral {DNA.} These results, as well as the recently published nucleotide sequences of other {HTLV-III} isolates, indicate that the most substantial variation among {HTLV-III} isolates is located in the envelope. These findings raise the possibility that viral isolates from different individuals could have important biological differences in their envelope antigens, a consideration relevant to ongoing attempts to develop a vaccine against {HTLV-III.}},

To provide durable clinical benefit, emergence of drug resistance is countered by prescription of alternative drug regimens.

However, {HIV-1} subtype B currently accounts for only 12\% of the estimated 40 million {HIV} infected individuals worldwide. The global {HIV-1} epidemic includes infection with nine identified {HIV-1} group M subtypes ({A–K)}, as well as distinct sub-subtypes and numerous chimerical or recombinant forms.

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} and simian immunodeficiency virus ({SIV)} genomes encode several auxiliary proteins that have increasingly shown their importance in the virus-host relationship. One of these proteins, Vpx, is unique to the {HIV-2/SIVsm} lineage and is critical for viral replication in macrophages. The functional basis for this requirement, as well as the Vpx mode of action, has remained unexplained, and it is all the more enigmatic that {HIV} type 1 ({HIV-1)}, which has no Vpx counterpart, can infect macrophages. Here, we underscore {DCAF1} as a critical host effector of Vpx in its ability to mediate infection and long-term replication of {HIV-2} in human macrophages. Vpx assembles with the {CUL4A-DDB1} ubiquitin ligase through {DCAF1} recruitment. Precluding Vpx present in the incoming virions from recruiting {DCAF1} in target macrophages leads to a postentry block characterized by defective accumulation of {HIV-2} reverse transcripts. In addition, Vpx from {SIVsm} functionally complements Vpx-defective {HIV-2} in a {DCAF1-binding-dependent} manner. Altogether, our data point to a mechanism in which Vpx diverts the {Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1} ligase to inactivate an evolutionarily conserved factor, which restricts macrophage infection by {HIV-2} and closely related simian viruses.},

This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded {DNA}, double-stranded {DNA} and {RNA)} to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation {DNA} sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under \$1,000.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To identify a new circulating recombinant form ({CRF)} of {HIV-1} comprising two circulating subtypes in the southern region in Brazil, subtypes B and C.
{METHODS:} A total of 152 {HIV-positive} patients followed at two hospitals in southern Brazil had their viral pol genes isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ({PCR)} from plasma. {PCR} products were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed using {HIV-1} subtype reference sequences. Six full-length subtype C viruses from Brazil previously described as 'pure' strains were included in the analysis. Sequences suggestive of recombination were analysed by boot scanning and phylogenetic analyses of separate fragments. The common ancestry of recombinant strains was evaluated by similarity plot and informative site analyses.
{RESULTS:} : {HIV-1} subtypes commonly found in Brazil (B, C and F1) were observed. Sixty-two viruses were initially assigned as subtype C, but 15 viruses clustered in a separate internal clade. Pol from two full-length genomes of subtype C viruses grouped together with those samples. Boot scanning analysis showed that all 17 viruses had the same recombinant structure, with a 240 base pair fragment of subtype B in the middle of the reverse transcriptase pol region. Subtype B assignment of this fragment was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using different methods of tree inference and cluster robustness tests. Mosaics were shown to have a common ancestry.
{CONCLUSION:} As {CRF\_BC} represents 11\% of the {HIV-1} viruses circulating in the southern region of the country, which borders several south American countries, the assessment of its spread is of pivotal importance to the {HIV/AIDS} epidemic in Brazil and Latin America.},

Near full-length viral genomes were amplified by using a long {PCR} technique, sequenced in their entirety, and phylogenetically analyzed. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed 10.2, 6.3, and 17.3\% diversity in predicted Gag, Pol, and Env protein sequences. Ten of 13 viruses were nonmosaic subtype C genomes, while all three isolates from China represented {B/C} recombinants. One of them was composed primarily of subtype C sequences with three small subtype B portions in gag, pol, and nef genes. Two others exhibited these same mosaic regions, but contained two additional subtype B portions at the gag/pol overlap and in the accessory gene region, suggesting ongoing {B/C} recombination in China. All subtype C genomes contained a prematurely truncated second exon of rev, but other previously proposed subtype C signatures, including three potential {NF-kappa} B-binding sites in the viral promoter-enhancer regions, were found in only a subset of these genomes.},

	abstract = {{HIV} is among the most generically variable of human pathogens. A comprehensive and detailed description of {HIV} strains in the pandemic is an important foundation for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The current sequence database for {HIV} includes almost 800 complete genome sequences, documenting {HIV-1} groups M, O, and N, and {HIV-2.} Among {HIV-1} group M strains, responsible for the vast majority of {HIV} infections worldwide, 743 sequences represent 9 genetic subtypes, 16 circulating recombinant forms ({CRF)} that are spreading in populations, and a variety of unique recombinant forms ({URF)}, identified so far only from a single individual. The global distribution of {HIV} is complex and dynamic with regional epidemics harboring only a subset of the global diversity. {HIV} strains differ enormously in terms of global prevalence. Six strains account for the majority of {HIV} infections: {HIV-1} subtypes A, B, C, D, and two of the {CRF}, {CRF01-AE} and {CRF02\_AG}, respectively. Many of the known subtypes and recombinant forms are currently rare in the epidemic, but could spread more widely if favorable conditions arise. {HIV-2} is largely restricted to West Africa at relatively low prevalence there. Groups O and N of {HIV-1} are very rare in the pandemic. The goal of universal coverage of {HIV-1} strains by diagnostic tests can be met by minimizing false negative test rates for the six globally prevalent {HIV-1} group M strains and {HIV-2}, and by evaluating systematically coverage of rare subtypes and recombinant forms.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to document the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} in the Democratic Republic of Congo ({DRC;} formerly Zaire). A total of 247 {HIV-1-positive} samples, collected during an epidemiologic survey conducted in 1997 in three regions (Kinshasa [the capital], Bwamanda [in the north], and Mbuyi-Maya [in the south]), were genetically characterized in theenv V3-V5 region. All known subtypes were found to cocirculate, and for 6\% of the samples the subtype could not be identified. Subtype A is predominant, with prevalences decreasing from north to south (69\% in the north, 53\% in the capital city, and 46\% in the south). Subtype C, D, G, and H prevalences range from 7 to 9\%, whereas subtype F, J, K, and {CRF01-AE} strains represent 2 to 4\% of the samples; only one subtype B strain was identified. The highest prevalence (25\%) of subtype C was in the south, and {CRF01-AE} was seen mainly in the north. The high intersubtype variability among the V3-V5 sequences is the most probable reason for the low (45\%) efficiency of subtype A-specific {PCR} and {HMA} (heteroduplex mobility assay). Eighteen (29\%) of 62 samples had discordant subtype designations betweenenv and gag. Sequence analysis of the entire envelope from 13 samples confirmed the high degree of diversity and complexity of {HIV-1} strains in the {DRC;} 9 had a complex recombinant structure in gp160, involving fragments of known and unknown subtypes. Interestingly, the unknown fragments from the different strains did not cluster together. Overall, the high number of {HIV-1} subtypes cocirculating, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible recombinant viruses as well as different unclassified strains are all in agreement with an old and mature epidemic in the {DRC}, suggesting that this region is the epicenter of {HIV-1} group M.},

Perhaps the greatest challenge comes from the realization that {HIV} is not a single virus, but a group of related viruses. The remarkable genetic heterogeneity of {HIV} enables certain {HIV} strains to elude detection by some of our most widely used serologic assays, to develop resistance to antiviral compounds within weeks to months, and to escape from immune responses generated by natural infection and immunization.

Using a {YBF30} V3 loop peptide enzyme immunoassay, we screened 700 {HIV-1-positive} sera collected in Cameroon; three reacted strongly with the {YBF30} peptides and one was confirmed as being related to {YBF30} by genetic analysis of a pol fragment. {YBF30} is as distinct from {SIVcpz-gab} as it is from {HIV-1} group M and can thus be considered as the prototype strain of a new human immunodeficiency virus group.},

To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically {HIV-1-infected} persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered {MHC-I} downregulatory function under Gag-specific {CTL} immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with {MHC-I} downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations ({A84D}, {Y135F}, and {G140R)} that ablated {MHC-I} downregulation and 3 ({N52A}, {S169I}, and {V180E)} that partially impaired {MHC-I} downregulation. Globally, the {CTL} pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked {MHC-I} downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that {CTL} pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for {MHC-I} downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo.},

	abstract = {The etiological agent of {AIDS}, {LAV/HTLV-III}, is common in Central Africa but is not endemic in other areas of that continent. A novel human retrovirus, distinct from {LAV/HTLV-III}, has now been isolated from two {AIDS} patients from West Africa. Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological and morphological properties very similar to {LAV} but that it differs in some of its antigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, the West African {AIDS} retrovirus and {LAV} differ substantially in their envelope glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized by serum from a macaque with simian {AIDS} infected by the simian retrovirus termed {STLV-IIImac}, suggesting that the West African {AIDS} virus may be more closely related to this simian virus than to {LAV.} Hybridization experiments with {LAV} subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to as {LAV-II}, is distantly related to {LAV} and distinct from {STLV-IIImac.}},

Several of the viral proteins also differed in molecular weight from the corresponding {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} proteins. Partial chemical cleavage of the most highly conserved viral proteins resulted in patterns which differed from those of {HIV-1} and {HIV-2.} Furthermore, nucleic acid hybridization experiments were capable of discriminating between the virus types. Sequence analysis of the viral U3 region revealed a unique enhancer organization not found in other immunodeficiency viruses.

The p14 is present in {SIVMne} in molar amounts equivalent to those of the gag proteins. This is the first example of a retrovirus that contains a substantial quantity of a viral protein that is not a product of the gag, pro, pol, or env genes. {SIV} p14 and its homolog in {HIV-2} may function as nucleic acid binding proteins since purified p14 binds to single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro. Antisera to the purified protein detected p14 in {SIVMne}, {SIVmac}, and a homologous protein (16 kilodaltons) in {HIV-2} but did not react with {HIV-1.} Diagnostic procedures based on this novel protein will distinguish between {HIV-1} and {HIV-2.}},

The date of the most recent common ancestor of {HIV-2} subtype A strains was estimated to be 1940 ± 16 and that of B strains was estimated to be 1945 ± 14. In addition we used coalescent theory to estimate the past population dynamics of {HIV-2} subtype A in a rural population of Guinea-Bissau. Parametric and nonparametric estimates of the effective number of infections through time were obtained for an equal sample of gag, pol, and env sequences. Our estimates of the epidemic history of {HIV-2} subtype A in Guinea-Bissau show a transition from constant size to rapid exponential growth around 1955–1970. Our analysis provides evidence for a zoonotic transfer of {HIV-2} during the first half of the 20th century and an epidemic initiation in Guinea-Bissau that coincides with the independence war (1963–1974), suggesting that war-related changes in sociocultural patterns had a major impact on the {HIV-2} epidemic.},

Using {HIV-1-} and {HIV-2-specific} enzyme immunoassays and confirmatory Western blot analysis to test for antibodies to {SIVsm-related} lentiviruses, we found only nine subjects (0.096\%) who tested positive for {HIV:} seven tested positive for {HIV-1} and two tested positive for {HIV-2.} Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra Leone displayed the lowest seroprevalence (0.021\%) of {HIV-2} infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported seroprevalence in {SIVsm-infected} feral and household pet sooty mangabeys. Heteroduplex analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found {HIV-1} strains belonged to subtype A, the most common {HIV-1} subtype in Africa, but this is the first report of subtype A in Sierra Leone. The two {HIV-2-infected} individuals harbored two distinct {HIV-2} strains, designated {93SL1} and {93SL2.} Phylogenetic analysis indicated that {HIV-2} {93SL1} is a member of {HIV-2} subtype A, the first strain of this {HIV-2} subtype found in Sierra Leone. In contrast, {HIV-2} {93SL2} belongs to none of the five previously characterized {HIV-2} subtypes (A to E) but is a new subtype, herein designated F, having the most divergent transmembrane sequences yet reported for {HIV-2.} The fact that both of the two most divergent {HIV-2} subtypes known, E and F, are rare and found as single occurrences in persons from Sierra Leone may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains free-living and household pet sooty mangabeys with highly divergent variants of {SIVsm.} This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new {HIV-2} subtypes result from independent cross-species transmission of {SIVsm} to the human population and that these single-occurrence transmission events had not spread widely into the population by 1993.},

 Recent data regarding the consequences of untreated human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} infection and the expansion of treatment choices for antiretroviral-naive and antiretroviral-experienced patients warrant an update of the International {AIDS} {Society–USA} guidelines for the use of antiretroviral therapy in adults with {HIV} {infection.Objectives}  
 To provide updated recommendations for management of {HIV-infected} adults, using antiretroviral drugs and laboratory monitoring tools available in the international, developed-world setting. This report provides guidelines for when to initiate antiretroviral therapy, selection of appropriate initial regimens, patient monitoring, when to change therapy, and what regimens to use when {changing.Data} Sources and Study Selection  
 A panel with expertise in {HIV} research and clinical care reviewed relevant data published or presented at selected scientific conferences since the last panel report through April 2010. Data were identified through a {PubMed} search, review of scientific conference abstracts, and requests to antiretroviral drug manufacturers for updated clinical trials and adverse event {data.Data} Extraction and Synthesis  
 New evidence was reviewed by the panel. Recommendations were drafted by section writing committees and reviewed and edited by the entire panel. The quality and strength of the evidence were rated and recommendations were made by full panel {consensus.Conclusions}  
 Patient readiness for treatment should be confirmed before initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Therapy is recommended for asymptomatic patients with a {CD4} cell count {≤500/μL}, for all symptomatic patients, and those with specific conditions and comorbidities. Therapy should be considered for asymptomatic patients with {CD4} cell count {\textgreater}{500/μL.} Components of the initial and subsequent regimens must be individualized, particularly in the context of concurrent conditions. Patients receiving antiretroviral treatment should be monitored regularly; treatment failure should be detected and managed early, with the goal of therapy, even in heavily pretreated patients, being {HIV-1} {RNA} suppression below commercially available assay quantification limits.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Despite} declines in morbidity and mortality with the use of combination antiretroviral therapy, its effectiveness is limited by adverse events, problems with adherence, and resistance of the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV).METHODS:We} randomly assigned persons infected with {HIV} who had a {CD4+} cell count of more than 350 per cubic millimeter to the continuous use of antiretroviral therapy (the viral suppression group) or the episodic use of antiretroviral therapy (the drug conservation group). Episodic use involved the deferral of therapy until the {CD4+} count decreased to less than 250 per cubic millimeter and then the use of therapy until the {CD4+} count increased to more than 350 per cubic millimeter. The primary end point was the development of an opportunistic disease or death from any cause. An important secondary end point was major cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic {disease.RESULTS:A} total of 5472 participants (2720 assigned to drug conservation and 2752 to viral suppression) were followed for an average of 16 months before the protocol was modified for the drug conservation group. At baseline, the median and nadir {CD4+} counts were 597 per cubic millimeter and 250 per cubic millimeter, respectively, and 71.7\% of participants had plasma {HIV} {RNA} levels of 400 copies or less per milliliter. Opportunistic disease or death from any cause occurred in 120 participants (3.3 events per 100 person-years) in the drug conservation group and 47 participants (1.3 per 100 person-years) in the viral suppression group (hazard ratio for the drug conservation group vs. the viral suppression group, 2.6; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 1.9 to 3.7; P{\textless}0.001). Hazard ratios for death from any cause and for major cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic disease were 1.8 (95\% {CI}, 1.2 to 2.9; P=0.007) and 1.7 (95\% {CI}, 1.1 to 2.5; P=0.009), respectively. Adjustment for the latest {CD4+} count and {HIV} {RNA} level (as time-updated covariates) reduced the hazard ratio for the primary end point from 2.6 to 1.5 (95\% {CI}, 1.0 to {2.1).CONCLUSIONS:Episodic} antiretroviral therapy guided by the {CD4+} count, as used in our study, significantly increased the risk of opportunistic disease or death from any cause, as compared with continuous antiretroviral therapy, largely as a consequence of lowering the {CD4+} cell count and increasing the viral load. Episodic antiretroviral therapy does not reduce the risk of adverse events that have been associated with antiretroviral therapy.},

	abstract = {Background: Measurements of the ionic current flowing through nanometer-scale pores (nanopores) have been used to analyze single {DNA} and {RNA} molecules, with the ultimate goal of achieving ultrafast {DNA} sequencing. However, attempts at purely electronic measurements have not achieved the signal contrast required for single nucleotide differentiation. In this report we propose a novel method of optical detection of {DNA} sequence translocating through a nanopore.
Methods: Each base of the target {DNA} sequence is 1st mapped onto a 2-unit code, 2 10-bp nucleotide sequence, by biochemical conversion into Designed {DNA} Polymers. These 2-unit codes are then hybridized to complementary, fluorescently labeled, and self-quenching molecular beacons. As the molecular beacons are sequentially unzipped during translocation through a {\textless}2-nm-wide nanopore, their fluorescent tags are unquenched and are detected by a custom-built dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence ({TIRF)} microscope. The 2-color optical signal is then correlated to the target {DNA} sequence.
Results: A dual-color {TIRFM} microscope with single-molecule resolution was constructed, and controlled fabrication of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays of solid-state nanopores was performed. A nanofluidic cell assembly was constructed for {TIRF-based} optical detection of voltage-driven {DNA} translocation through a nanopore.
Conclusions: We present a novel nanopore-based {DNA} sequencing technique that uses an optical readout of {DNA} translocating unzipping through a nanopore. Our technique offers better single nucleotide differentiation in sequence readout, as well as the possibility of large-scale parallelism using nanopore arrays.},

Background. Most human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} point-of-care tests detect antibodies (Ab) but not p24 antigen (Ag) or {RNA.} In the absence of antibodies, p24 antigen and {RNA} typically indicate acute {HIV} infection. We conducted a field evaluation of the Determine® {HIV-1/2} {Ag/Ab} Combo rapid test (Combo {RT).}
Methods. The antigen portion of the Combo {RT} (for acute {HIV} infection) was compared with a Roche Monitor {HIV} {RNA} polymerase chain reaction assay. The antibody portion of Combo {RT} (for established {HIV} infection) was compared with rapid test algorithms. Participants were enrolled at a sexually transmitted infection clinic and {HIV} testing and counseling center in Lilongwe, Malawi. Rapid testing was conducted with parallel testing in the clinic and serial testing in the center. The Combo {RT} was performed in clinic participants with negative or discordant antibody results and in all center participants.
Results. Of the participants 838 were {HIV} negative, 163 had established {HIV} infection, and 8 had acute {HIV} infection. For detecting acute {HIV} infection, the antigen portion had a sensitivity of 0.000 and a specificity of 0.983. For detecting established {HIV} infection, the antibody portion had a sensitivity of 0.994 and a specificity of 0.992.
Conclusions. Combo {RT} displayed excellent performance for detecting established {HIV} infection and poor performance for detecting acute {HIV} infection. In this setting, Combo {RT} is no more useful than current algorithms.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} p24 antigen (p24) measurement by signal amplification-boosted {ELISA} of heat-denatured plasma is being evaluated as an alternative to {HIV-1} {RNA} quantitation in resource-poor settings. Some observations suggested that virion-associated p24 is suboptimally detected using Triton X-100-based virus dissociation buffer (kit buffer). A new reagent ({SNCR} buffer) containing both denaturing and non-denaturing detergents was therefore developed and evaluated. The {SNCR} buffer increased the measured p24 concentration about 1.5- to 3-fold in {HIV-negative} plasma reconstituted with purified {HIV-1} particles, while not increasing the background. Among 127 samples of {HIV-1-positive} patients with moderate to high concentrations of {HIV-1} {RNA} the increase was about threefold across the entire concentration range (P {\textless} 0.0001). Specificity before neutralization among prospectively tested clinical samples ruled {HIV-negative} was 828 of 845 (98.0\%) for the {SNCR} buffer and 464 of 479 (96.9\%) for kit buffer. Specificity after confirmatory neutralization of reactive samples or a follow-up test was 100\% with either buffer. Surprisingly, the {SNCR} buffer revealed a p24 reactivity in 115 of 187 samples (61.5\%) from adult patients exhibiting undetectable {HIV-1} {RNA} below 5 copies/ml for a duration of 6-30 months under {HAART} (3.7\% with kit buffer). The rate of p24 reactivity in these patients did not decrease with duration of {HAART.} In conclusion, the {SNCR} buffer improves the detection of particle-associated {HIV-1} p24, thereby increasing the measured p24 concentration in samples with medium to high {HIV-1} {RNA.} It also uncovers the presence of a p24 reactivity, whose identity remains to be determined, in a significant fraction of samples with undetectable {HIV-1} {RNA} under long-term {HAART.}},

	abstract = {Background. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate methods of detecting clients with sexually transmitted diseases ({STDs)} who were acutely coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} in Lilongwe, Malawi.
Methods. After informed consent was obtained, all clients with acute {STDs} were offered voluntary {HIV} counseling and testing by 2 rapid antibody tests. Samples from rapid test-negative or -discordant subjects were pooled (50:5:1) and tested for {HIV} {RNA.} Western blots were performed on all rapid test-discordant specimens with detectable {HIV} {RNA.} A subset of specimens received p24 antigen testing with standard and/or ultrasensitive methods. Patients with possible acute {HIV} infection were followed to confirm seroconversion.
Results. A total of 1450 clients (34\% female and 66\% male) agreed to testing, of whom 588 (40.55\%) had established {HIV} infection and 21 (1.45\%) had acute infection. Discordant rapid antibody tests identified 7 of 21 (33.3\% sensitivity), standard p24 antigen identified 12 of 16 (75\% sensitivity), and ultrasensitive p24 antigen identified 15 of 17 (88\% sensitivity) acute cases. By definition, the sensitivity of the {RNA} assay was 100\%.
Conclusions. Real-time pooled {RNA} testing for the detection of acute {HIV} infection is feasible in resource-limited settings. However, parallel rapid testing and p24 antigen testing are technologically simpler and together may detect ∼90\% of acute cases.},

drug resistance is correlated with poor virologic response to new therapy. 
The International {AIDS} {Society–USA} sought to update prior recommendations 
to provide guidance for clinicians regarding indications for {HIV-1} resistance 
{testing.Participants}  
                  An International {AIDS} {Society–USA} 13-member physician panel with 
expertise in basic science, clinical research, and patient care involving 
{HIV} resistance to antiretroviral drugs was reconvened to provide recommendations 
for the clinical use of drug resistance {testing.Evidence} and Consensus Process  
                  The full panel met regularly between January and October 1999. Resistance 
and resistance testing data appearing in the last decade through April 2000 
and presentations at national and international research conferences were 
reviewed. Recommendations and considerations were developed by 100\% group 
consensus, acknowledging that definitive data to support final recommendations 
are not yet {available.Conclusions}  
                  Emerging data indicate that despite limitations, resistance testing 
should be incorporated into patient management in some settings. Resistance 
testing is recommended to help guide the choice of new regimens after treatment 
failure and for guiding therapy for pregnant women. It should be considered 
in treatment-naive patients with established infection, but cannot be firmly 
recommended in this setting. Testing also should be considered prior to initiating 
therapy in patients with acute {HIV} infection, although therapy should not 
be delayed pending the results. Expert interpretation is recommended given 
the complexity of results and assay limitations.},

 Transmission of multiclass drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus

{treatment.Design}, Setting, and Patients  
 Consecutive case series of 225 patients referred to a San Francisco, 
Calif, hospital with recent {HIV-1} infection from June 1996 through June {2001.Main} Outcome Measure  
 Time trends in the prevalence of genotypic and phenotypic primary drug 
{resistance.Results}  
 Mutations associated with resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors ({NNRTIs)} steadily increased from 0\% in 1996-1997 to 12 (13.2\%) 
in 2000-2001 (P = .01). There was 1 mutation associated 
with protease inhibitor resistance in 1996-1997 (2.5\%) and there were 7 (7.7\%) 
in 2000-2001 (P = .25). Genotypic resistance to nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NRTIs)} initially decreased and then returned 
to prior levels (P = .007 for test of homogeneity). 
Genotypic resistance to 2 or more classes of drugs increased from 1 (2.5\%) 
to 12 (13.2\%) (P = .004), but only 1 infection (1.2\%) 
in the latter period was resistant to all 3 classes of agents (P = .58). Primary phenotypic resistance decreased for {NRTIs} from 21\% 
to 6.2\% (P = .03) and increased for {NNRTIs} from 0 
to 8 (9.9\%) (P = .02). Phenotypic resistance increased 
for protease inhibitors from 2.6\% to 6.2\% (P = .32). 
Median time to virologic suppression ({\textless}500 {copies/mL)} during therapy was 
12 weeks for patients with genotypic evidence of resistance compared with 
5 weeks for patients with drug-sensitive infections (P 
= {.02).Conclusions}  
 The frequency of primary resistance to {NNRTIs} is increasing, although 
resistance to all available classes of antiretroviral therapy remains rare. 
Genotypic resistance testing in recently infected persons predicts time to 
viral suppression during therapy.},

to any nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 6 subjects, and to 
any protease inhibitors in 2 cases. Multidrug-resistant virus was identified 
in 3 individuals (3.8\%). Extensive polymorphism in the protease gene was identified. 
Interpretation of genotypes and phenotypes was concordant in 57 (85\%) of the 
67 cases in which both studies were {performed.Conclusion}  
                  The prevalence of {HIV-1} variants with known resistance-conferring genotypes 
to any antiretroviral agent in this cohort of 80 newly infected individuals

of primary {HIV-1} infection. Clinical trials should be initiated to establish 
whether therapy guided by resistance testing, compared with the use of empirical 
triple combination antiretroviral therapy, provides additional virological 
and immunological benefit when treating primary {HIV-1} infection. Further efforts 
to expand the study of transmission of drug-resistant {HIV-1} variants, particularly 
in cohorts with different epidemiological profiles, are indicated.},

	abstract = {It is almost 20 years since {NNRTIs} were identified as a new class of antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection. Although they belong to different and diverse chemical families, they share a common and unique mechanism of action: their interaction with {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase induces conformational changes that inhibit the catalytic activities of the enzyme. They are characterized by their specificity for {HIV-1}, which makes them very selective inhibitors of the virus. First generation {NNRTIs} nevirapine and efavirenz, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, have become a cornerstone for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection, in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Further research has led to the discovery and development of next generation {NNRTIs} with an increased genetic barrier to the development of resistance. Etravirine is the first {NNRTI} to show sustained virologic efficacy in patients with {NNRTI} resistant {HIV-1.} This review covers the {NNRTI} class of anti-{HIV-1} drugs, from the initial discovery of the class in 1990 to the current compounds in clinical development, i.e. around 20 years of research and development efforts. It describes the characteristics of the {NNRTIs}, their mechanisms of action, {HIV-1} resistance to the inhibitors, and the drugs that have been approved for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection, or are currently in clinical development. The role of {NNRTIs} in prevention of {HIV} transmission is also addressed.

Starting from the {HEPT} and {TIBO} derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as {NNRTIs}, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to {HIV-1} replication and targeted at the {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT).} Two {NNRTIs} (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide {UC-781}, {HEPT} derivative {MKC-442}, quinoxaline {HBY} 097 and {DMP} 266 (efavirenz)]. The {NNRTIs} interact with a specific `pocket' site of {HIV-1} {RT} that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the {NRTI} binding site. {NNRTIs} are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the {NNRTI-binding} site. However, the emergence of resistant {HIV} strains can be circumvented if the {NNRTIs}, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to `knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of {NNRTIs} (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with {NRTIs} ({AZT}, {3TC}, {ddI} or {d4T)} and/or {PIs} (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-{HIV} activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma {HIV-1} {RNA} levels and increased {CD4} T-lymphocyte counts.},

{DATA} {SOURCES:} Articles were identified through searches of {MEDLINE} (May 2000-August 2009) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (May 1998-August 2009), using the key words etravirine, rilpivirine, {TMC125}, {TMC278}, diarylpyrimidine, {NNRTI}, and resistance.
{STUDY} {SELECTION} {AND} {DATA} {EXTRACTION:} Clinical trials, resistance studies, and pharmacokinetic data were selected for review.
{DATA} {SYNTHESIS:} {NNRTIs} are an integral class of antiretroviral agents utilized for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection. These agents have become preferred therapy options for treatment-naïve individuals per treatment guideline recommendations and have gained increased popularity over protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. However, available {NNRTIs} possess inherent characteristics, such as low genetic barrier to resistance and high degree of cross-resistance, that limit their use in {HIV} therapy. Due to the growing utilization of this highly efficacious antiretroviral class and the increased capability for resistance development, many {HIV-infected} patients have experienced treatment failure of an {NNRTI.} Cross-resistance makes other first-generation {NNRTI} agents unavailable for future use. Etravirine and rilpivirine are second-generation {NNRTIs} that are not significantly hampered by cross-resistance and possess potent antiretroviral activity against current {NNRTI-resistant} viral strains. These agents provide new and important therapy options for many {HIV-infected} patients.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {NNRTI} resistance is an increasing problem that may impair the chances for therapeutic success in {HIV-infected} patients. Novel agents such as etravirine and rilpivirine provide new, sensitive options for patients and significantly improve the rate of virologic suppression when appropriately applied.},

	abstract = {Background: Efavirenz is a second-generation non-nucleoside inhibitor of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} that has recently been approved for use against {HIV-1} infection. Compared with first-generation drugs such as nevirapine, efavirenz shows greater resilience to drug resistance mutations within {HIV-1} {RT.} In order to understand the basis for this resilience at the molecular level and to help the design of further-improved anti-{AIDS} drugs, we have determined crystal structures of efavirenz and nevirapine with wild-type {RT} and the clinically important {K103N} mutant. Results: The relatively compact efavirenz molecule binds, as expected, within the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket of {RT.} There are significant rearrangements of the drug binding site within the mutant {RT} compared with the wild-type enzyme. These changes, which lead to the repositioning of the inhibitor, are not seen in the interaction with the first-generation drug nevirapine. Conclusions: The repositioning of efavirenz within the drug binding pocket of the mutant {RT}, together with conformational rearrangements in the protein, could represent a general mechanism whereby certain second-generation non-nucleoside inhibitors are able to reduce the effect of drug-resistance mutations on binding potency.},

The polymerase (pol) domain of the 66-kilodalton subunit has a large cleft analogous to that of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli {DNA} polymerase I. However, the 51-kilodalton subunit of identical sequence has no such cleft because the four subdomains of the pol domain occupy completely different relative positions. Two of the four pol subdomains appear to be structurally related to subdomains of the Klenow fragment, including one containing the catalytic site. The subdomain that appears likely to bind the template strand at the pol active site has a different structure in the two polymerases. Duplex A-form {RNA-DNA} hybrid can be model-built into the cleft that runs between the ribonuclease H and pol active sites. Nevirapine is almost completely buried in a pocket near but not overlapping with the pol active site. Residues whose mutation results in drug resistance have been approximately located.},

However, patients receiving protease inhibitors develop a marked lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia. Using cultured human and rat hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice, we demonstrate that protease inhibitor treatment inhibits proteasomal degradation of nascent apolipoprotein B, the principal protein component of triglyceride and cholesterol-rich plasma lipoproteins. Unexpectedly, protease inhibitors also inhibited the secretion of apolipoprotein B. This was associated with inhibition of cholesteryl-ester synthesis and microsomal triglyceride transfer-protein activity. However, in the presence of oleic acid, which stimulates neutral-lipid biosynthesis, protease-inhibitor treatment increased secretion of apolipoprotein B-lipoproteins above controls. These findings suggest a molecular basis for protease-inhibitor−associated hyperlipidemia, a serious adverse effect of an otherwise efficacious treatment for {HIV} infection.},

Potential microbicide candidates must be both safe and effective. Using cellular and tissue explant models, we have evaluated the activity of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ({NNRTI)} dapivirine as a vaginal microbicide. In tissue compatibility studies, dapivirine was well tolerated by epithelial cells, T cells, macrophages, and cervical tissue explants. Dapivirine demonstrated potent dose-dependent inhibitory effects against a broad panel of {HIV} type 1 isolates from different clades. Furthermore, dapivirine demonstrated potent activity against a wide range of {NNRTI-resistant} isolates. In human cervical explant cultures, dapivirine was able not only to inhibit direct infection of mucosal tissue but also to prevent the dissemination of the virus by migratory cells. Activity was retained in the presence of semen or a cervical mucus simulant. Furthermore, dapivirine demonstrated prolonged inhibitory effects: it was able to prevent both localized and disseminated infection for as long as 6 days posttreatment. The prolonged protection observed following pretreatment of genital tissue and the lack of observable toxicity suggest that dapivirine has considerable promise as a potential microbicide candidate.},

	abstract = {{HIV} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} is one of the main targets for the action of anti-{AIDS} drugs. The selection of drug-resistant {HIV} is a key problem in the continued treatment of the infection and thus new drugs are required. A significant body of information consisting of {HIV-1} {RT} crystal structures with bound inhibitors has become available during the past several years, and, increasingly, such data will be of use in developing novel inhibitors. Two examples of crystal structures of {HIV-1} {RT} with bound inhibitors have been published recently, one with the non-nucleoside {CP94707} and the second with the nucleotide analogue drug tenofovir. Such structures will help the design of new drugs and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of resistance.},

	abstract = {The rapid replication of {HIV-1} and the errors made during viral replication cause the virus to evolve rapidly in patients, making the problems of vaccine development and drug therapy particularly challenging. In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs are the only useful treatment. Anti-{HIV} drugs work; so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life. Unfortunately, {HIV-1} develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful anti-{HIV} drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase ({RT)}, integrase ({IN)}, and protease ({PR)} are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of {RT} inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of {RT}, have been approved to treat {HIV-1} infections, nucleoside analogs ({NRTIs)} and nonnucleosides ({NNRTIs)}, and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the {RNase} H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of {RT} and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular, drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of {HIV-1.}},

Based on our previously described dynamic copy-choice mechanism for retroviral recombination and our observations that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NRTIs)} increase the frequency of reverse transcriptase template switching, we propose that an equilibrium exists between (i) {NRTI} incorporation, {NRTI} excision, and resumption of {DNA} synthesis and (ii) degradation of the {RNA} template by {RNase} H activity, leading to dissociation of the template-primer and abrogation of {HIV-1} replication. As predicted by this model, mutations in the {RNase} H domain that reduced the rate of {RNA} degradation conferred high-level resistance to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine and 2,3-didehydro-2,3-dideoxythymidine by as much as 180- and 10-fold, respectively, by increasing the time available for excision of incorporated {NRTIs} from terminated primers. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which {NRTIs} inhibit {HIV-1} replication and imply that mutations in {RNase} H could significantly contribute to drug resistance either alone or in combination with {NRTI-resistance} mutations in reverse transcriptase.},

Structural determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} that influence its template-switching frequency are not known. To identify determinants of {HIV-1} {RT} that affect the frequency of template switching, we developed an in vivo assay in which {RT} template-switching events during viral replication resulted in functional reconstitution of the green fluorescent protein gene. A survey of single amino acid substitutions near the polymerase active site or deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding site of {HIV-1} {RT} indicated that several substitutions increased the rate of {RT} template switching. Several mutations associated with resistance to antiviral nucleoside analogs ({K65R}, {L74V}, {E89G}, {Q151N}, and {M184I)} dramatically increased {RT} template-switching frequencies by two- to sixfold in a single replication cycle. In contrast, substitutions in the {RNase} H domain ({H539N}, {D549N)} decreased the frequency of {RT} template switching by twofold. Depletion of intracellular nucleotide pools by hydroxyurea treatment of cells used as targets for infection resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the frequency of {RT} template switching. These results indicate that the dynamic steady state between polymerase and {RNase} H activities is an important determinant of {HIV-1} {RT} template switching and establish that {HIV-1} recombination occurs by the previously described dynamic copy choice mechanism. These results also indicate that mutations conferring resistance to antiviral drugs can increase the frequency of {RT} template switching and may influence the rate of retroviral recombination and viral evolution.},

We compared wild-type {RT} with the {D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q}, {D67N/K70R}, and {T215F/K219Q} mutant enzymes. The {D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q} mutant showed increased {DNA} polymerase processivity; this resulted from decreased template/primer dissociation from {RT}, and was due to the {T215F/K219Q} mutations. The {D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q} mutant was less sensitive to {AZTTP} ({IC50} approximately 300 {nM)} than wt {RT} ({IC50} approximately 100 {nM)} in the presence of 0.5 {mM} pyrophosphate. This change in pyrophosphate-mediated sensitivity of the mutant enzyme was selective for {AZTTP}, since similar Km values for {TTP} and inhibition by {ddCTP} and {ddGTP} were noted with wt and mutant {RT} in the absence or in the presence of pyrophosphate. The {D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q} mutant showed an increased rate of pyrophosphorolysis (the reverse reaction of {DNA} synthesis) of chain-terminated {DNA;} this enhanced pyrophosphorolysis was due to the {D67N/K70R} mutations. However, the processivity of pyrophosphorolysis was similar for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. We propose that {HIV-1} resistance to {AZT} results from the selectively decreased binding of {AZTTP} and the increased pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of chain-terminated viral {DNA} by the mutant {RT} at physiological pyrophosphate levels, resulting in a net decrease in chain termination. The increased processivity of viral {DNA} synthesis may be important to enable facile {HIV} replication in the presence of {AZT}, by compensating for the increased reverse reaction rate.},

With the identification of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)‐1} as the infectious agent leading to acquired immune deficiency syndrome ({AIDS)}, the viral reverse transcriptase ({RT)} has been a primary focus for drug discovery and development. Currently, two classes of {RT} inhibitors are used clinically. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NRTIs)} and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NNRTIs)} have been used clinically in the treatment of {HIV‐1} infection. This chapter describes the current clinically used {RT} inhibitors, outlining mechanisms of action as well as factors in {HIV} resistance to these drugs. In addition, some promising new pipeline {RT} inhibitors are discussed, including compounds directed at novel {RT} targets not addressed by current {RT} therapeutics, such as inhibitors of {RT} ribonuclease H ({RNH)} activity. There are a number of new {NRTIs} and {NNRTIs}, with improved resistance profiles, in late stage clinical development, and there are many others in preclinical development.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of inhibition of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase by three nonnucleoside inhibitors is described. Nevirapine, O-{TIBO}, and {CI-TIBO} each bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme-{DNA} complex close to the active site catalytic residues. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was used to establish the mechanism of inhibition by these noncompetitive inhibitors. Analysis of the pre-steady-state burst of {DNA} polymerization indicated that inhibitors blocked the chemical reaction, but did not interfere with nucleotide binding or the nucleotide-induced conformational change. Rather, in the presence of saturating concentrations of the inhibitors, the nucleoside triphosphate bound tightly (Kd, 100 {nM)}, but nonproductively. The data suggest that an inhibitor combining the functionalities of a nonnucleoside inhibitor and a nucleotide analog could bind very tightly and specifically to reverse transcriptase and could be effective in the treatment of {AIDS.}},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus {HIV-1} establishes persistent infections in humans which lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ({AIDS).} The {HIV-1} envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells. {HIV-1} entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell, {CD4} and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding,. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, {CD4} and a neutralizing antibody. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions. Understanding the structural basis for the ability of {HIV-1} to evade the humoral immune response should assist in the design of a vaccine.},

	abstract = {Retroviral proteins are synthesized as polyprotein precursors that undergo proteolytic cleavages to yield the mature viral proteins. The role of the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} protease in the viral replication cycle was examined by use of a site-directed mutation in the protease gene. The {HIV} protease gene product was expressed in Escherichia coli and observed to cleave {HIV} gag p55 to gag p24 and gag p17 in vitro. Substitution of aspartic acid residue 25 (Asp-25) of this protein with an asparagine residue did not affect the expression of the protein, but it eliminated detectable in vitro proteolytic activity against {HIV} gag p55. A mutant {HIV} provirus was constructed that contained the Asn-25 mutation within the protease gene. {SW480} human colon carcinoma cells transfected with the Asn-25 mutant proviral {DNA} produced virions that contained gag p55 but not gag p24, whereas virions from cells transfected with the wild-type {DNA} contained both gag p55 and gag p24. The mutant virions were not able to infect {MT-4} lymphoid cells. In contrast, these cells were highly sensitive to infection by the wild-type virions. These results demonstrate that the {HIV} protease is an essential viral enzyme and, consequently, an attractive target for anti-{HIV} drugs.},

	abstract = {{HIV} protease plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle and is essential for the generation of mature infectious virus particles. Detailed knowledge of the structure of {HIV} protease and its substrate has led to the design of specific {HIV} protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance to all protease inhibitors ({PIs)} has been observed and the genetic basis of resistance has been well documented over the past 15 years. The arrival of the early {PIs} was a pivotal moment in the development of antiretroviral therapy. They made possible the dual class triple combination therapy that became known as {HAART.} However, the clinical utility of the first generation of {PIs} was limited by low bioavailability and high pill burdens, which ultimately reduced adherence and limited long-term viral inhibition. When therapy failure occurred multiple protease resistance mutations were observed, often resulting in broad class resistance. To combat {PI-resistance} development, second-generation approaches have been developed. The first advance was to increase the level of existing {PIs} in the plasma by boosting with ritonavir. The second was to develop novel {PIs} with high potency against the known {PI-resistant} {HIV} protease variants. Both approaches increased the number of protease mutations required for clinical resistance, thereby raising the genetic barrier. This review provides an overview of the history of protease inhibitor therapy, its current status and future perspectives. It forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.},

Virus populations with greater than 100-fold-increased resistance to both inhibitors compared with the parental virus have been obtained. {DNA} sequence analyses of the protease genes from {VB-11},328- and {VX-478-resistant} variants reveal a sequential accumulation of point mutations, with similar resistance patterns occurring for the two inhibitors. The deduced amino acid substitutions in the resistant protease are Leu-10--{\textgreater}Phe, Met-46--{\textgreater}Ile, Ile-47--{\textgreater}Val, and Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val. This is the first observation in {HIV} protease resistance studies of an Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val mutation, a mutation that appears to arise uniquely against the sulfonamide inhibitor class. When the substitutions observed were introduced as single mutations into an {HIV-1} infectious clone ({HXB2)}, only the Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val mutant showed reduced sensitivity (two- to threefold) to {VB-11},328 and {VX-478.} A triple protease mutant infectious clone carrying the mutations Met-46--{\textgreater}Ile, Ile-47--{\textgreater}Val, and Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val, however, showed much greater reduction in sensitivity (14- to 20-fold) to {VB-11},328 and {VX-478.} The same mutations were studied in recombinant {HIV} protease. The mutant protease Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val displays a much lower affinity for the inhibitors than the parent enzyme ({\textless} or = 80-fold). The protease triply mutated at Met-46--{\textgreater}Ile, Ile-47--{\textgreater}Val, and Ile-50--{\textgreater}Val shows an even greater decrease in inhibitor binding ({\textless} or = 270-fold). The sulfonamide-resistant {HIV} protease variants remain sensitive to inhibitors from other chemical classes (Ro 31-8959 and L-735,524), suggesting possibilities for clinical use of {HIV} protease inhibitors in combination or serially.},

	abstract = {{BMS-232632} is an azapeptide human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} protease (Prt) inhibitor that exhibits potent anti-{HIV} activity with a 50\% effective concentration ({EC50)} of 2.6 to 5.3 {nM} and an {EC90} of 9 to 15 {nM} in cell culture. Proof-of-principle studies indicate that {BMS-232632} blocks the cleavage of viral precursor proteins in {HIV-infected} cells, proving that it functions as an {HIV} Prt inhibitor. Comparative studies showed that {BMS-232632} is generally more potent than the five currently approved {HIV-1} Prt inhibitors. Furthermore, {BMS-232632} is highly selective for {HIV-1} Prt and exhibits cytotoxicity only at concentrations 6,500- to 23,000-fold higher than that required for anti-{HIV} activity. To assess the potential of this inhibitor when used in combination with other antiretrovirals, {BMS-232632} was evaluated for anti-{HIV} activity in two-drug combination studies. Combinations of {BMS-232632} with either stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or amprenavir in {HIV-infected} peripheral blood mononuclear cells yielded additive to moderately synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, combinations of drug pairs did not result in antagonistic anti-{HIV} activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation. Our results suggest that {BMS-232632} may be an effective {HIV-1} inhibitor that may be utilized in a variety of different drug combinations.},

	abstract = {To date, numerous inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease have been reported, but few have been studied extensively in humans, primarily as a consequence of poor oral bioavailability in animal models. L-735,524 represents a class of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitors, termed hydroxyaminopentane amides, that incorporate a basic amine into the hydroxyethylene inhibitor backbone. L-735,524 is a potent inhibitor of virus replication in cell culture and inhibits the protease-mediated cleavage of the viral precursor polyproteins that results in the production of noninfectious progeny viral particles. The compound is effective against viruses resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and is synergistically active when used in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Most importantly, L-735,524 exhibits good oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles in two species of laboratory animals by using clinically acceptable formulations. Accordingly, the compound was selected for evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetic studies in humans.},

	abstract = {Boosted protease inhibitor regimens combine ritonavir with a second, ‘boosted’ protease inhibitor to enhance patient exposure to the latter agent, thereby preventing or overcoming resistance and allowing less frequent dosing, potentially improving adherence. The advantages offered by ritonavir boosting are primarily attributable to the drug’s pharmacokinetic properties. Ritonavir’s inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 {CYP3A4} enzyme reduces the metabolism of concomitantly administered protease inhibitors and changes their pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the curve ({AUC)}, maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin) and half-life (t1/2). As a result, the bioavailability of the boosted protease inhibitor is increased and improved penetration into {HIV} reservoirs may be achieved. Boosted protease inhibitor regimens that utilize a low dose of ritonavir (100–200 mg) appear to offer the best balance of efficacy and tolerability. At this dose, ritonavir boosts the bioavailability of the second protease inhibitor without contributing significantly to the side effect profile of the regimen. In clinical trials, regimens boosted with low dose ritonavir have demonstrated high levels of viral suppression in both antiretroviral naïve patients and patients who previously failed antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitor therapy. Side effects observed have generally been similar to those associated with the boosted protease inhibitor. Based upon their enhanced drug exposure and demonstrated efficacy, the boosted ritonavir regimens should be among the first options considered for use in clinical practice.},

The aim of therapy is complete virological suppression, with a current goal of {\textless}50 {copies/mL} {HIV-1} {RNA}, in order to minimize the occurrence of drug resistance. Improved understanding of the pharmacology of {PIs}, primarily the importance of adequate drug exposure, has led to the widespread administration of {PIs} combined with a low ‘boosting’ dose of ritonavir. The combination of {PIs} with ritonavir can improve treatment responses in both treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Boosted {PIs} are an important therapeutic option for {HIV} and extensive data exist supporting their use. Use of individual agents should be guided by a resistance test at all stages of treatment from naive through to highly treatment-experienced patients. Currently, seven boosted {PIs} have both {US} and European licensing approval: indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, tipranavir and darunavir (formerly {TMC114).} The preferred first-line option in the {USA} is lopinavir. Many of the older {PIs} are less effective and/or have less favourable tolerability profiles. Emergent {PI} resistance is a major challenge in treatment, and it can be accelerated by partial suppression of viral load through inappropriate therapy combinations. Using the newer boosted {PIs}, which have more robust resistance profiles, with an optimized background regimen may increase the likelihood of complete viral suppression. This review discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of boosted {PIs} in current practice.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although regimens containing two protease inhibitor ({PI)} together with ritonavir boosting are used with the aim of improving virologic response to salvage therapy, there is little evidence to support or reject this approach. We compared the probability of attaining an undetectable {HIV} {RNA} level after using either boosted double or boosted single {PI} regimens. Design: Retrospective clinical cohort. Methods: {PI-experienced} subjects in a Northern California-based database who initiated either a boosted single or boosted double {PI} salvage therapy regimen were analysed. Traditional multivariable regression and marginal structural model analyses were used to compare the effects of the two regimens on virologic suppression 12–36 weeks after initiation of salvage therapy, controlling for confounding by baseline {HIV} {RNA} level, {CD4} lymphocyte count, treatment history, drug resistance, and multiple characteristics of the salvage regimen. Results: Fifty-one percent of boosted single {PI} regimens (n=805) and 51.6\% of boosted double {PI} regimens (n=183) achieved a plasma {HIV} {RNA} level of {\textless}75{\textgreater}copies/ml at week 12–36. In models including multiple potentially confounding variables, estimates of the relative odds of suppression on boosted double versus boosted single {PI} regimens ranged from 1.17 (95\% {CI}, 0.54–2.55) to 1.33 (95\% {CI}, 0.82–2.14). Conclusions: We were not able to reject the null hypothesis that boosted double versus boosted single {PI} regimens, resulted in equivalent probabilities of virologic success.},

	abstract = {Background 
 Ultra-deep pyrosequencing ({UDPS)} allows identification of rare {HIV-1} variants and minority drug resistance mutations, which are not detectable by standard sequencing. 
 
 
 Principal Findings 
 Here, {UDPS} was used to analyze the dynamics of {HIV-1} genetic variation in reverse transcriptase ({RT)} (amino acids 180–220) in six individuals consecutively sampled before, during and after failing {3TC} and {AZT} containing antiretroviral treatment. Optimized {UDPS} protocols and bioinformatic software were developed to generate, clean and analyze the data. The data cleaning strategy reduced the error rate of {UDPS} to an average of 0.05\%, which is lower than previously reported. Consequently, the cut-off for detection of resistance mutations was very low. A median of 16,016 (range 2,406–35,401) sequence reads were obtained per sample, which allowed detection and quantification of minority resistance mutations at amino acid position 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215 and 219 in {RT.} In four of five pre-treatment samples low levels (0.07–0.09\%) of the {M184I} mutation were observed. Other resistance mutations, except {T215A} and {T215I} were below the detection limit. During treatment failure, {M184V} replaced {M184I} and dominated the population in combination with {T215Y}, while wild-type variants were rarely detected. Resistant virus disappeared rapidly after treatment interruption and was undetectable as early as after 3 months. In most patients, drug resistant variants were replaced by wild-type variants identical to those present before treatment, suggesting rebound from latent reservoirs. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 With this highly sensitive {UDPS} protocol preexisting drug resistance was infrequently observed; only {M184I}, {T215A} and {T215I} were detected at very low levels. Similarly, drug resistant variants in plasma quickly decreased to undetectable levels after treatment interruption. The study gives important insights into the dynamics of the {HIV-1} quasispecies and is of relevance for future research and clinical use of the {UDPS} technology.},

{ObjectivesTo} compare the prevalence of drug-resistant variants detected with standard and ultra-deep sequencing (detection down to 1\% prevalence) and to determine the impact of minor resistant variants on virologic failure ({VF)}
{MethodsThe} Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies ({FIRST)} Study (N = 1397) compared 3 initial antiretroviral therapy ({ART)} strategies. A random subset (n = 491) had baseline testing for drug-resistance mutations performed by use of standard sequencing methods. Ultra-deep sequencing was performed on samples that had sufficient viral content (N = 264). Proportional hazards models were used to compare rates of {VF} for those who did and did not have mutations identified
{ResultsMutations} were detected by standard and ultra-deep sequencing (in 14\% and 28\% of participants, respectively; P{\textless}.001). Among individuals who initiated treatment with an {ART} regimen that combined nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (hereafter, {“NNRTI} strategy”), all individuals who had an {NNRTI-resistance} mutation identified by ultra-deep sequencing experienced {VF.} When these individuals were compared with individuals who initiated treatment with the {NNRTI} strategy but who had no {NNRTI-resistance} mutations, the risk of {VF} was higher for those who had an {NNRTI-resistance} mutation detected by both methods (hazard ratio [{HR]}, 12.40 [95\% confidence interval {\{CI\}}, 3.41–45.10]) and those who had mutation(s) detected only with ultra-deep sequencing ({HR}, 2.50 [95\% {CI}, 1.17–5.36])
{ConclusionsUltra-deep} sequencing identified a significantly larger proportion of {HIV-infected}, treatment-naive persons as harboring drug-resistant viral variants. Among participants who initiated treatment with the {NNRTI} strategy, the risk of {VF} was significantly greater for participants who had low- and high-prevalence {NNRTI-resistant} variants},

	abstract = {The process of integrating the reverse-transcribed {HIV-1} {DNA} into the host chromosomal {DNA} is catalyzed by the virally encoded enzyme integrase ({IN).} Integration requires two metal-dependent reactions, 3′ end processing and strand transfer. Compounds that contain a diketo acid moiety have been shown to selectively inhibit the strand transfer reaction of {IN} in vitro and in infected cells and are effective as inhibitors of {HIV-1} replication. To characterize the molecular basis of inhibition, we used functional assays and binding assays to evaluate a series of structurally related analogs. These studies focused on investigating the role of the conserved carboxylate and metal binding. We demonstrate that an acidic moiety such as a carboxylate or isosteric heterocycle is not required for binding to the enzyme complex but is essential for inhibition and confers distinct metal-dependent properties on the inhibitor. Binding requires divalent metal and resistance is metal dependent with active site mutants displaying resistance only when the enzymes are evaluated in the context of Mg2+. The mechanism of action of these inhibitors is therefore likely a consequence of the interaction between the acid moiety and metal ion(s) in the {IN} active site, resulting in a functional sequestration of the critical metal cofactor(s). These studies thus have implications for modeling active site inhibitors of {IN}, designing and evaluating analogs with improved efficacy, and identifying inhibitors of other metal-dependent phosphotransferases.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} integration protein, a potential target for selective antiviral therapy, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein, free of detectable contaminating endonucleases, selectively cleaved double-stranded {DNA} oligonucleotides that mimic the U3 and the U5 termini of linear {HIV} {DNA.} Two nucleotides were removed from the 3' ends of both the U5 plus strand and the U3 minus strand; in both cases, cleavage was adjacent to a conserved {CA} dinucleotide. The reaction was metal-ion dependent, with a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. Reaction selectivity was further demonstrated by the lack of cleavage of an {HIV} U5 substrate on the complementary (minus) strand, an analogous substrate that mimics the U3 terminus of an avian retrovirus, and an {HIV} U5 substrate in which the conserved {CA} dinucleotide was replaced with a {TA} dinucleotide. Such an integration protein-mediated cleavage reaction is expected to occur as part of the integration event in the retroviral life cycle, in which a double-stranded {DNA} copy of the viral {RNA} genome is inserted into the host cell {DNA.}},

The antiviral activity of these compounds is due exclusively to inhibition of one of the two catalytic functions of integrase, strand transfer.},

	abstract = {Background: To improve the existing combination therapies of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} and to cope with virus strains that are resistant to multiple drugs, we initiated a search for effective inhibitors of {HIV} integrase, the enzyme responsible for inserting the viral {cDNA} into the host cell chromosome. Results: We have now identified a series of {5H-pyrano[2},3-d:-6,5-d′]dipyrimidines that block the replication of various strains of {HIV-1} and {HIV-2.} The most potent congener, 5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2,8-dithiol-4,6-dihydroxy-{5H-pyrano[2},3-d:-6,5-d′]dipyrimidine (V-165), inhibited the replication of {HIV-1(IIIB)} in {MT-4} cells at a 50\% effective concentration ({EC50)} of 8.9 {μM}, which is 14-fold below its cytotoxic concentration. V-165 was equally active against virus strains that were resistant toward inhibitors of viral entry or reverse transcriptase. In combination regimens in cell culture, V-165 acted subsynergistically with zidovudine or nelfinavir and synergistically with nevirapine. V-165 inhibited both reverse transcriptase and integrase activities in enzymatic assays at micromolar concentrations, but only a close correlation was found between the anti-{HIV} activity observed in cell culture and the inhibitory activity in the integrase strand transfer assays. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that V-165 interfered with the viral replication cycle at a time point coinciding with integration. Quantitative Alu-{PCR} corroborated that the anti-{HIV} activity of V-165 is based upon the inhibition of proviral {DNA} integration. Conclusions: Based on their mode of action, which is different from that of clinically approved anti-{HIV} drugs, {PDPs} are good candidates for further development into new drugs and to be included in future combination regimens.},

	abstract = {Our prior studies showed that polyhydroxylated styrylquinolines are potent {HIV-1} integrase ({IN)} inhibitors that block the replication of {HIV-1} in cell culture at nontoxic concentrations. To explore the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, various novel styrylquinoline derivatives were synthesized and tested against {HIV-1} {IN} and in cell-based assays. Regarding the in vitro experiments, the structural requirements for biological activity are a carboxyl group at C-7, a hydroxyl group at C-8 in the quinoline subunit, and an ancillary phenyl ring. However the in vitro inhibitory profile tolerates deep alterations of this ring, e.g. by the introduction of various substituents or its replacement by heteroatomic nuclei. Regarding the ex vivo assays, the structural requirements for activity are more stringent than for in vitro inhibition. Thus, in addition to an o-hydroxy acid group in the quinoline, the presence of one ortho pair of substituents at C-3? and C-4?, particularly two hydroxyl groups, in the ancillary phenyl ring is imperatively required for inhibitory potency. Starting from literature data and the {SARs} developed in this work, a putative binding mode of styrylquinoline inhibitors to {HIV-1} {IN} was derived.},

Structure?activity studies reveal that the compounds possessing the pentatomic moiety {SC(O)CNC(O)} with two carbonyl groups are in general more potent against purified {IN} than those containing only one carbonyl group. Substitution with electron-donating or -withdrawing groups did not enhance nor abolish potency against purified {IN.} By contrast, compounds with a naphthalene ring system showed enhanced potency, suggesting that a hydrophobic pocket in the {IN} active site might accommodate an aromatic system rather than a halogen. The position of sulfur in the thiazole ring appears important for potency against {IN}, as its replacement with an oxygen or carbon abolished activity. Further extension of the thiazole ring diminished potency. Compounds 1, 19, and 20 showed antiviral activity and inhibited {IN} within similar concentrations. These compounds inhibited {IN} when Mn2+ or Mg2+ was used as cofactor. None of these compounds showed detectable activities against {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase, protease, virus attachment, or nucleocapsid protein zinc fingers. Therefore, thiazolothiazepines are potentially important lead compounds for development as inhibitors of {IN} and {HIV} replication.},

 To evaluate the association of preexisting drug-resistant {HIV-1} minority variants with risk of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ({NNRTI)–based} antiretroviral virologic {failure.Data} Sources  
 Systematic review of published and unpublished studies in {PubMed} (1966 through December 2010), {EMBASE} (1974 through December 2010), conference abstracts, and article references. Authors of all studies were contacted for detailed laboratory, {ART}, and adherence {data.Study} Selection and Data Abstraction  
 Studies involving {ART-naive} participants initiating {NNRTI-based} regimens were included. Participants were included if all drugs in their {ART} regimen were fully active by standard {HIV} drug resistance testing. Cox proportional hazard models using pooled patient-level data were used to estimate the risk of virologic failure based on a Prentice weighted case-cohort analysis stratified by {study.Data} Synthesis  
 Individual data from 10 studies and 985 participants were available for the primary analysis. Low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected in 187 participants, including 117 of 808 patients in the cohort studies. Low-frequency {HIV-1} drug resistance mutations were associated with an increased risk of virologic failure (hazard ratio ({HR]}, 2.3 [95\% confidence interval {\{CI\}}, 1.7-3.3]; P {\textless} .001) after controlling for medication adherence, race/ethnicity, baseline {CD4} cell count, and plasma {HIV-1} {RNA} levels. Increased risk of virologic failure was most strongly associated with minority variants resistant to {NNRTIs} ({HR}, 2.6 [95\% {CI}, 1.9-3.5]; P {\textless} .001). Among participants from the cohort studies, 35\% of those with detectable minority variants experienced virologic failure compared with 15\% of those without minority variants. The presence of minority variants was associated with 2.5 to 3 times the risk of virologic failure at either 95\% or greater or less than 95\% overall medication adherence. A dose-dependent increased risk of virologic failure was found in participants with a higher proportion or quantity of drug-resistant {variants.Conclusion}  
 In a pooled analysis, low-frequency {HIV-1} drug resistance mutations, particularly involving {NNRTI} resistance, were significantly associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of virologic failure with first-line {ART.}},

Several compounds which block the attachment of {HIV} gp120 to either the {CD4} T cell receptor or the {CCR5/CXCR4} co-receptors are currently in clinical development. Most of these compounds have different molecular structures and specific mechanisms of action. These agents are eagerly awaited by a growing number of patients carrying viruses resistant viruses to many of the current available reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. For enfuvirtide, the first and, so far, only entry inhibitor approved for clinical use, the main mechanism of resistance is the selection of changes within a 10 amino acid segment encompassing residues 36–45 within the {HR1} region of gp41. For other entry inhibitors, multiple changes in different gp120 domains (V1, V2, V3, C2 and C4) have been associated with loss of susceptibility to these agents, although in most cases with limited cross-resistance.},

	abstract = {{BMS-806} and the related compound, \#155, are novel inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} entry that bind the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. {BMS-806} and \#155 block conformational changes in the {HIV-1} envelope glycoproteins that are induced by binding to the host cell receptor, {CD4.} We tested a panel of {HIV-1} envelope glycoprotein mutants and identified several that were resistant to the antiviral effects of {BMS-806} and \#155. In the {CD4-bound} conformation of gp120, the amino acid residues implicated in {BMS-806} and \#155 resistance line the “phenylalanine 43 cavity” and a water-filled channel that extends from this cavity to the inner domain. Structural considerations suggest a model in which {BMS-806} and \#155 bind gp120 prior to receptor binding and, upon {CD4} binding, are accommodated in the Phe-43 cavity and adjacent channel. The integrity of the nearby {V1/V2} variable loops and N-linked carbohydrates on the {V1/V2} stem indirectly influences sensitivity to the drugs. A putative binding site for {BMS-806} and \#155 between the gp120 receptor-binding regions and the inner domain, which is thought to interact with the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, helps to explain the mode of action of these drugs.},

	abstract = {The entry of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} into cells requires the sequential interaction of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the {CD4} glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Although gpl20 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, {HIV} eludes the immune system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of an {HIV-1} gp120 core complexed with a two-domain fragment of human {CD4} and an antigen-binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden {CD4–gp120} interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon {CD4} binding, the nature of a {CD4-induced} antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion. Our results provide a framework for understanding the complex biology of {HIV} entry into cells and should guide efforts to intervene.},

	abstract = {{HIV} infection is initiated by the selective interaction between the cellular receptor {CD4} and gp120, the external envelope glycoprotein of the virus. We used analytical ultracentrifugation, titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis to characterize the assembly state, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the {CD4-gp120} interaction. The binding thermodynamics were of unexpected magnitude; changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity greatly exceeded those described for typical protein-protein interactions. These unusual thermodynamic properties were observed with both intact gp120 and a deglycosylated and truncated form of gp120 protein that lacked hypervariable loops V1, V2, and V3 and segments of its N and C termini. Together with previous crystallographic studies, the large changes in heat capacity and entropy reveal that extensive structural rearrangements occur within the core of gp120 upon {CD4} binding. {CD} spectral studies and slow kinetics of binding support this conclusion. These results indicate considerable conformational flexibility within gp120, which may relate to viral mechanisms for triggering infection and disguising conserved receptor-binding sites from the immune system.},

Further confirmation that {BMS-378806} targets the envelope in infected cells was obtained through the isolation of resistant variants and the mapping of resistance substitutions to the {HIV-1} envelope. In particular, two substitutions, {M426L} and {M475I}, are situated in the {CD4} binding pocket of gp120. Recombinant {HIV-1} carrying these two substitutions demonstrated significantly reduced susceptibility to compound inhibition. {BMS-378806} displays many favorable pharmacological traits, such as low protein binding, minimal human serum effect on anti-{HIV-1} potency, good oral bioavailability in animal species, and a clean safety profile in initial animal toxicology studies. Together, the data show that {BMS-378806} is a representative of a new class of {HIV} inhibitors that has the potential to become a valued addition to our current armamentarium of antiretroviral drugs.},

	abstract = {{BMS-378806} is a recently discovered small-molecule human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} attachment inhibitor with good antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we demonstrate that the compound targets viral entry by inhibiting the binding of the {HIV-1} envelope gp120 protein to cellular {CD4} receptors via a specific and competitive mechanism. {BMS-378806} binds directly to gp120 at a stoichiometry of approximately 1:1, with a binding affinity similar to that of soluble {CD4.} The potential {BMS-378806} target site was localized to a specific region within the {CD4} binding pocket of gp120 by using {HIV-1} gp120 variants carrying either compound-selected resistant substitutions or gp120-{CD4} contact site mutations. Mapping of resistance substitutions to the {HIV-1} envelope, and the lack of compound activity against a {CD4-independent} viral infection confirm the gp120-{CD4} interactions as the target in infected cells. {BMS-378806} therefore serves as a prototype for this new class of antiretroviral agents and validates gp120 as a viable target for small-molecule inhibitors.},

Infection of cells expressing the different {CXCR-4} deletion mutants by {HIV-1} {LAI} and 89.6 was reduced only about twofold. In contrast, the {HIV-1} {GUN-1} and {RF} isolates were substantially more impaired in their ability to mediate cell-free infection and cell–cell fusion. Since {LAI} and {RF} are T-cell line-tropic viruses while 89.6 and {GUN-1} are dual tropic, no clear correlation between tropism and requirements for {CXCR-4} N-terminal sequences emerged. We also introduced point mutations at the two N-linked glycosylation sites. The isolates tested ({LAI}, {RF}, {GUN-1}, and 89.6) were not affected by the removal of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in {CXCR-4.} We conclude that distinct virus strains interact differently with the {CXCR-4} coreceptor and that the N-terminal extracellular domain is not the sole functional domain important for {HIV-1} entry.},

Although receptor chimera studies have provided useful information, the domains of {CCR5} that function for {HIV-1} entry, including the site of gp120 interaction, have not been unambiguously identified. Here, we use site-directed, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of {CCR5} to show that substitutions of the negatively charged aspartic acid residues at positions 2 and 11 ({D2A} and {D11A)} and a glutamic acid residue at position 18 ({E18A)}, individually or in combination, impair or abolish {CCR5-mediated} {HIV-1} entry for the {ADA} and {JR-FL} M-tropic strains and the {DH123} dual-tropic strain. These mutations also impair Env-mediated membrane fusion and the gp120-{CCR5} interaction. Of these three residues, only D11 is necessary for {CC-chemokine-mediated} inhibition of {HIV-1} entry, which is, however, also dependent on other extracellular {CCR5} residues. Thus, the gp120 and {CC-chemokine} binding sites on {CCR5} are only partially overlapping, and the former site requires negatively charged residues in the amino-terminal {CCR5} domain.},

	abstract = {{CCR5} is a chemokine receptor expressed by T cells and macrophages, which also functions as the principal coreceptor for macrophage (M)-tropic strains of {HIV-1.} To understand the molecular basis of the binding of chemokines and {HIV-1} to {CCR5}, we developed a number of {mAbs} that inhibit the various interactions of {CCR5}, and mapped the binding sites of these {mAbs} using a panel of {CCR5/CCR2b} chimeras. One {mAb} termed {2D7} completely blocked the binding and chemotaxis of the three natural chemokine ligands of {CCR5}, {RANTES} (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein ({MIP)-1α}, and {MIP-1β}, to {CCR5} transfectants. This {mAb} was a genuine antagonist of {CCR5}, since it failed to stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the {CCR5} transfectants, but blocked calcium responses elicited by {RANTES}, {MIP-1α}, or {MIP-1β.} This {mAb} inhibited most of the {RANTES} and {MIP-1α} chemotactic responses of activated T cells, but not of monocytes, suggesting differential usage of chemokine receptors by these two cell types. The {2D7} binding site mapped to the second extracellular loop of {CCR5}, whereas a group of {mAbs} that failed to block chemokine binding all mapped to the {NH2-terminal} region of {CCR5.} Efficient inhibition of an M-tropic {HIV-1–derived} envelope glycoprotein gp120 binding to {CCR5} could be achieved with {mAbs} recognizing either the second extracellular loop or the {NH2-terminal} region, although the former showed superior inhibition. Additionally, {2D7} efficiently blocked the infectivity of several M-tropic and dual-tropic {HIV-1} strains in vitro. These results suggest a complicated pattern of {HIV-1} gp120 binding to different regions of {CCR5}, but a relatively simple pattern for chemokine binding. We conclude that the second extracellular loop of {CCR5} is an ideal target site for the development of inhibitors of either chemokine or {HIV-1} binding to {CCR5.}},

The epitopes for these {mAbs} were determined by using various {CCR5} mutants, including {CCR5/CCR2B} chimeras. One {mAb}, {ROAb13}, was found to bind to a linear epitope in the N terminus of {CCR5.} Strikingly, the other five {mAbs} bind to epitopes derived from extracellular loop 2 ({ECL2).} The three most potent {mAbs}, {ROAb12}, {ROAb14}, and {ROAb18}, require residues from both the N-terminal (Lys171 and Glu172) and C-terminal (Trp190) halves of {ECL2} for binding; two other {mAbs}, {ROAb10} and {ROAb51}, which also showed potent antiviral activities, require Lys171 and Glu172 but not Trp190 for binding. Binding of the control {mAb} {2D7} completely relies on Lys171 and Glu172. Unlike {2D7}, the novel {mAbs} {ROAb12}, {ROAb14}, and {ROAb18} do not bind to the linear peptide {2D7-2SK.} In addition, all three {mAbs} bind to monkey {CCR5} (with Arg at position 171 instead of Lys); however, {2D7} does not. Since five of the six most potent {CCR5} {mAbs} derived from the same pool of immunized mice require {ECL2} as epitopes, we hypothesize that {CCR5} {ECL2} contains the dominant epitopes for {mAbs} with potent antiviral activities. These dominant epitopes were found in {CCR5} from multiple species and were detected in large proportions of the total cell surface {CCR5.} {mAbs} recognizing these epitopes also showed high binding affinity. A homology model of {CCR5} was generated to aid in the interpretation of these dominant epitopes in {ECL2.}},

However, no study to date has examined whether monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, or other nonchemokine agents possess broad-spectrum activity against the major genetic subtypes of {HIV-1.} {PRO} 140 ({PA14)} is an anti-{CCR5} monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits {HIV-1} entry at concentrations that do not affect {CCR5's} chemokine receptor activity. In this study, {PRO} 140 was tested against a panel of primary {HIV-1} isolates selected for their genotypic and geographic diversity. In quantitative assays of viral infectivity, {PRO} 140 was compared with {RANTES}, a natural {CCR5} ligand that can inhibit {HIV-1} entry by receptor downregulation as well as receptor blockade. Despite their divergent mechanisms of action and binding epitopes on {CCR5}, low nanomolar concentrations of both {PRO} 140 and {RANTES} inhibited infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC)} by all {CCR5-using} (R5) viruses tested. This is consistent with there being a highly restricted pattern of {CCR5} usage by R5 viruses. In addition, a panel of 25 subtype C South African R5 viruses were broadly inhibited by {PRO} 140, {RANTES}, and {TAK-779}, although ∼30-fold-higher concentrations of the last compound were required. Interestingly, significant inhibition of a dualtropic subtype C virus was also observed. Whereas {PRO} 140 potently inhibited {HIV-1} replication in both {PBMC} and primary macrophages, {RANTES} exhibited limited antiviral activity in macrophage cultures. Thus {CCR5-targeting} agents such as {PRO} 140 can demonstrate potent and genetic-subtype-independent anti-{HIV-1} activity.},

Currently, several novel coreceptor inhibitors are being developed in the clinic, and early results have proven promising. In this report, we describe a novel {CCR5} antagonist, vicriviroc (formerly {SCH-D} or {SCH} 417690), with improved antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic properties compared to those of {SCH-C}, a previously described {CCR5} antagonist. Like {SCH-C}, vicriviroc binds specifically to the {CCR5} receptor and prevents infection of target cells by {CCR5-tropic} {HIV-1} isolates. In antiviral assays, vicriviroc showed potent, broad-spectrum activity against genetically diverse and drug-resistant {HIV-1} isolates and was consistently more active than {SCH-C} in inhibiting viral replication. This compound demonstrated synergistic anti-{HIV} activity in combination with drugs from all other classes of approved antiretrovirals. Competition binding assays revealed that vicriviroc binds with higher affinity to {CCR5} than {SCH-C.} Functional assays, including inhibition of calcium flux, guanosine 5′-[{35S]triphosphate} exchange, and chemotaxis, confirmed that vicriviroc acts as a receptor antagonist by inhibiting signaling of {CCR5} by chemokines. Finally, vicriviroc demonstrated diminished affinity for the human ether a-go-go related gene transcript ion channel compared to {SCH-C}, suggesting a reduced potential for cardiac effects. Vicriviroc represents a promising new candidate for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection.},

	abstract = {Background. Vicriviroc, an investigational {CCR5} inhibitor, demonstrated short-term antiretroviral activity in a phase 1 study.
Methods. The present study was a double-blind, randomized phase 2 study of vicriviroc in treatment-experienced, human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)–infected} subjects experiencing virologic failure while receiving a ritonavir-containing regimen with an {HIV-1} {RNA} level ⩾5000 {copies/mL} and {CCR5-using} virus. Vicriviroc at 5, 10, or 15 mg or placebo was added to the failing regimen for 14 days, after which the antiretroviral regimen was optimized. The primary end point was the change in plasma {HIV-1} {RNA} levels at day 14; secondary end points included safety/tolerability and {HIV-1} {RNA} level changes at week 24.
Results. One hundred eighteen subjects were randomized with a median {HIV-1} {RNA} level of 36,380 (4.56 log10) {copies/mL} and a median {CD4} cell count of 146 cells/mm3. At 14 days and 24 weeks, mean changes in {HIV-1} {RNA} level (log10 {copies/mL)} were greater in the vicriviroc groups (−0.87 and −1.51 [5 mg], −1.15 and −1.86 [10 mg], and −0.92 and −1.68 [15 mg]), than in the placebo group (+0.06 and −0.29) (P{\textless}.01). Grade 3/4 adverse events were similar across groups. Malignancies occurred in 6 subjects randomized to vicriviroc and in 2 to placebo.
Conclusions. In {HIV-1–infected}, treatment-experienced patients, vicriviroc demonstrated potent virologic suppression through 24 weeks. The relationship of vicriviroc to malignancy is uncertain. Further development of vicriviroc in treatment-experienced patients is warranted.},

Compounds targeting {CCR5-mediated} entry are a novel class of drugs being developed to treat {HIV-1} infection. In this study, we have identified the mechanism of action of two inhibitors of {CCR5} function, {SCH-350581} ({AD101)} and {SCH-351125} ({SCH-C).} {AD101} is more potent than {SCH-C} at inhibiting {HIV-1} replication in primary lymphocytes, as well as viral entry and gp120 binding to cell lines. Both molecules also block the binding of several anti-{CCR5} monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the second extracellular loop of {CCR5.} Alanine mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of {CCR5} suggests that {AD101} and {SCH-C} bind to overlapping but nonidentical sites within a putative ligand-binding cavity formed by transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, and 7. We propose that the binding of small molecules to the transmembrane domain of {CCR5} may disrupt the conformation of its extracellular domain, thereby inhibiting ligand binding to {CCR5.}},

The {CCR5} antagonist aplaviroc ({APL)} is active against Maraviroc-resistant viral strains but its clinical development has ended because of dose-related toxicity. Here we demonstrate that reduction of {CCR5} density (receptors/cell) with the immunomodulatory drug rapamycin ({RAPA)} enhances the antiviral activity of {APL}, allowing lower, non-toxic effective doses. In the presence of {RAPA}, the concentration of {APL} required for 90\% inhibition of R5 {HIV-1} in primary {CD4} lymphocytes was reduced by as much as 25-fold. We conclude that low doses of {RAPA} may reduce the anti-{HIV} effective dose of {APL-derivatives} currently in development and thus minimize their potential toxicity. Combinations of {RAPA} and {CCR5} antagonists could provide an effective means to control drug-resistant R5 {HIV} in patients, most notably those infected with Maraviroc-resistant viruses.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
In approximately 70\% of individuals infected with {HIV-1} subtype B, the virus switches coreceptor use from exclusively {CCR5} use (R5 virus) to either inclusion of or exclusively {CXCR4} use (X4 virus) during infection. This switch is associated with an accelerated loss of {CD4+} T-cells and a faster progression to {AIDS.} Despite intensive research, the mechanisms responsible for coreceptor switch remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated associations between viral evolutionary rate and selection pressure versus viral coreceptor use and rate of disease progression in eight patients with longitudinally sampled {HIV-1} env V1-{–V3} sequences. By employing a Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic model, we found that the {HIV-1} evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than with rate of disease progression in terms of {CD4+T-cell} decline. Phylogenetic analyses showed that X4 variants evolved from R5 populations. In addition, coreceptor switch was associated with higher evolutionary rates on both the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution level, but not with {dN/dS} ratio rates. Our findings suggest that X4 viruses evolved from pre-existing R5 viral populations and that the evolution of coreceptor switch is governed by high replication rates rather than by selective pressure. Furthermore, the association of viral evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than disease progression. This adds to the understanding of the complex virus–host interplay that influences the evolutionary dynamics of {HIV-1} coreceptor use.},

This has been correlated with accelerated disease progression in {HIV-1} subtype B. Basic knowledge of {HIV-1} coreceptor tropism is important due to the recent introduction of coreceptor antagonists in antiretroviral therapy, and subtype-specific differences regarding how frequently {HIV-1} {CXCR4-using} populations appear in late-stage disease need to be further investigated. To study how frequently {CXCR4-using} populations appear in late-stage disease among {HIV-1} subtype A and {CRF02\_AG}, we evaluated the accuracy of a recombinant virus phenotypic assay for these subtypes, and used it to determine the {HIV-1} coreceptor tropism of plasma samples collected during late-stage disease in Guinea-Bissau. We also performed a genotypic analysis and investigated subtype-specific differences in the appearance of {CXCR4} tropism late in disease.},

	abstract = {{AMD070} is an oral {CXCR4} antagonist with in vitro activity against X4-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Thirty fasting healthy male volunteers received oral doses of {AMD070} ranging from a single 50-mg dose to seven 400-mg doses given every 12 h (q12h). Nine subjects received a 200-mg dose during fasting and prior to a meal. Subjects were monitored for safety and pharmacokinetics. {AMD070} was well tolerated, without serious adverse events. Transient headaches (13 subjects) and neurocognitive (8 subjects) and gastrointestinal (7 subjects) symptoms were the most common complaints. Seven subjects had sinus tachycardia, and two were symptomatic. {AMD070} plasma concentrations peaked 1 to 2 h after patient dosing. The estimated terminal half-life ranged from 11.2 to 15.9 h among cohorts. Dose proportionality was not demonstrated. Less than 1\% of the drug appeared unchanged in the urine. Food reduced the maximum concentration of drug in serum and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h by 70\% and 56\%, respectively (P ≤ 0.01). A dose-dependent elevation of white blood cells ({WBC)} demonstrated a maximum twofold increase over baseline (95\% confidence interval, 2.0- to 2.1-fold) in an Emax model. In healthy volunteers, {AMD070} was well tolerated and demonstrated mixed-order pharmacokinetics, and food reduced drug exposure. {AMD070} induced a dose-related elevation of {WBC} which was attributed to {CXCR4} blockade. Using leukocytosis as a surrogate marker for {CXCR4} inhibition, this dose-response relationship suggests that the doses used in this study were active in vivo, though not maximal, throughout the dosing interval. Trough concentrations with the 400-mg dose q12h exceeded the antiviral in vitro 90\% effective concentration of {AMD070.}},

It also inhibited binding of the {CXC} chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor 1α, to {CXCR4} specifically and subsequent signal transduction. {KRH-1636} prevented monoclonal antibodies from binding to {CXCR4} without down-modulation of the coreceptor. The inhibitory effect against X4 viral replication by {KRH-1636} was clearly reproduced in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse system. Furthermore, this compound was absorbed into the blood after intraduodenal administration as judged by anti-{HIV-1} activity and liquid chromatography {MS} in the plasma.

	abstract = {The bipartite envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} performs two essential functions for initiating virus infection. The gp120 surface subunit of Env binds cell receptors to attach virus to target cells and regulate viral entry. The gp41 transmembrane subunit fuses host-cell and viral membranes to deliver the viral core into the cell cytoplasm. The two subunits derive from a polyprotein precursor, gp160. Cleavage of gp160 in the biosynthetic pathway creates mature Env consisting of the noncovalently-associated gp120/gp41 that is primed for viral entry. While performing distinct operations in {HIV} entry, the activities of the gp120 and gp41 subunits must be highly coordinated in order to lead to successful infection. This review highlights structure-function relationships in Env, with a focus on the heptad-repeat regions in the ectodomain of gp41. The mechanism of Env-mediated membrane fusion and ways to interfere with this process using inhibitors and antibodies that target gp41 are discussed.},

data sources: English-language {MEDLINE} and {AIDSline} searches were performed (1966-January 2003) using enfuvirtide, T-20, gp41, and fusion inhibitors as key words. Abstracts from infectious diseases and {HIV} scientific meetings were identified.
data extraction: All publications and meeting abstracts were reviewed and relevant items included. In vitro and preclinical studies were included, as well as Phase {II} and {III} clinical trials.
data synthesis: Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor used for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection. Given its unique mechanism of action, most {HIV-1} isolates are susceptible to enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide is administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily. In clinical trials with antiretroviral-experienced patients, enfuvirtide was effective at suppressing {HIV-RNA} and increasing {CD4+} T-cell counts. Enfuvirtide should be used in combination with other active antiretroviral agents to optimize its efficacy and limit resistance. Injection site reactions associated with administration of the drug are experienced in the majority of patients. Availability of enfuvirtide may be limited by a complex manufacturing procedure.
conclusions: Enfuvirtide is an effective treatment option for {HIV-1-infected} individuals when used in combination with other antiretroviral agents. It may be used as part of a regimen for treatment-experienced patients.},

	abstract = {Enfuvirtide ({ENF)} is currently the only {FDA} approved {HIV} fusion inhibitor in clinical use. Searching for more drugs in this category with higher efficacy and lower toxicity seems to be a logical next step. In line with this objective, a synthetic peptide with 36 amino acid residues, called Sifuvirtide ({SFT)}, was designed based on the crystal structure of gp41. In this study, we show that {SFT} is a potent anti-{HIV} agent with relatively low cytotoxicity. {SFT} was found to inhibit replication of all tested {HIV} strains. The effective concentrations that inhibited 50\% viral replication ({EC50)}, as determined in all tested strains, were either comparable or lower than benchmark values derived from well-known anti-{HIV} drugs like {ENF} or {AZT}, while the cytotoxic concentrations causing 50\% cell death ({CC50)} were relatively high, rendering it an ideal anti-{HIV} agent. A {GST-pull} down assay was performed to confirm that {SFT} is a fusion inhibitor. Furthermore, the activity of {SFT} on other targets in the {HIV} life cycle was also investigated, and all assays showed negative results. To further understand the mechanism of action of {HIV} peptide inhibitors, resistant variants of {HIV-1IIIB} were derived by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of {SFT} or {ENF.} The results showed that there was cross-resistance between {SFT} and {ENF.} In conclusion, {SFT} is an ideal anti-{HIV} agent with high potency and low cytotoxicity, but may exhibit a certain extent of cross-resistance with {ENF.}},

The emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses results from the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy and involves the combined effects of different drug-resistance mutations. The optimization of current antiretroviral drug regimens and the development of new drugs are challenging issues in {HIV} chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {An important component of triple-drug anti-{AIDS} therapy is 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine ({3TC}, lamivudine). Single mutations at residue 184 of the reverse transcriptase ({RT)} in {HIV} cause high-level resistance to {3TC} and contribute to the failure of anti-{AIDS} combination therapy. We have determined crystal structures of the {3TC-resistant} mutant {HIV-1} {RT} ({M184I)} in both the presence and absence of a {DNA/DNA} template-primer. In the absence of a {DNA} substrate, the wild-type and mutant structures are very similar. However, comparison of crystal structures of {M184I} mutant and wild-type {HIV-1} {RT} with and without {DNA} reveals repositioning of the template-primer in the {M184I/DNA} binary complex and other smaller changes in residues in the {dNTP-binding} site. On the basis of these structural results, we developed a model that explains the ability of the {3TC-resistant} mutant {M184I} to incorporate {dNTPs} but not the nucleotide analog {3TCTP.} In this model, steric hindrance is expected for {NRTIs} with β- or l- ring configurations, as with the enantiomer of {3TC} that is used in therapy. Steric conflict between the oxathiolane ring of {3TCTP} and the side chain of β-branched amino acids (Val, Ile, Thr) at position 184 perturbs inhibitor binding, leading to a reduction in incorporation of the analog. The model can also explain the {3TC} resistance of analogous hepatitis B polymerase mutants. Repositioning of the template-primer as observed in the binary complex ({M184I/DNA)} may also occur in the catalytic ternary complex ({M184I/DNA/3TCTP)} and contribute to {3TC} resistance by interfering with the formation of a catalytically competent closed complex.},

	abstract = {Treating {HIV} infections with drugs that block viral replication selects for drug-resistant strains of the virus. Particular inhibitors select characteristic resistance mutations. In the case of the nucleoside analogs {3TC} and {FTC}, resistant viruses are selected with mutations at amino acid residue 184 of reverse transcriptase ({RT).} The initial change is usually to {M184I;} this virus is rapidly replaced by a variant carrying the mutation {M184V.} {3TC} and {FTC} are taken up by cells and converted into {3TCTP} and {FTCTP.} The triphosphate forms of these nucleoside analogs are incorporated into {DNA} by {HIV-1} {RT} and act as chain terminators. Both of the mutations, {M184I} and {M184V}, provide very high levels of resistance in vivo; purified {HIV-1} {RT} carrying {M184V} and {M184I} also shows resistance to {3TCTP} and {FTCTP} in in vitro polymerase assays. Amino acid M184 is part of the {dNTP} binding site of {HIV-1} {RT.} Structural studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance of {HIV-1} {RTs} carrying the {M184V} or {M184I} mutation involves steric hindrance, which could either completely block the binding of {3TCTP} and {FTCTP} or allow binding of these nucleoside triphosphate molecules but only in a configuration that would prevent incorporation. The available kinetic data are ambiguous: one group has reported that the primary effect of the mutations is at the level of {3TCTP} binding; another, at the level of incorporation. We have approached this problem using assays that monitor the ability of {HIV-1} {RT} to undergo a conformational change upon binding a {dNTP.} These studies show that both wild-type {RT} and the drug-resistant variants can bind {3TCTP} at the polymerase active site; however, the binding to {M184V} and {M184I} is somewhat weaker and is sensitive to salt. We propose that the drug-resistant variants bind {3TCTP} in a strained configuration that is salt-sensitive and is not catalytically competent.},

	abstract = {Although anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} therapy has prolonged the lives of patients, drug resistance is a significant problem. Of particular concern are mutations that cause cross-resistance to a particular class of drugs. Among the mutations that cause resistance to several nucleoside analogs are the insertion of amino acids in the fingers subdomain of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} at positions 69 and 70. These insertions are usually associated with changes in the flanking amino acids and with a change to F or Y at position 215. We have proposed that the {T215F/Y} mutation makes the binding of {ATP} to {HIV-1} {RT} more effective, which increases the excision of 3-azido-3′-deoxythymidine-5′-monophosphate ({AZTMP)} in vitro and increases zidovudine ({AZT)} resistance in vivo. Although the mechanism of {AZT} resistance involves enhanced excision, resistance to {3TC} involves a block to incorporation of the analog. We measured the effects of fingers insertion mutations on the misincorporation and excision of several nucleoside analogs. {RT} variants with the amino acid insertions in the fingers and {T215Y} have a decreased level of misincorporation of {ddATP} and {3TCTP.} These mutants also have the ability to excise {AZTMP} by {ATP-dependent} pyrophosphorylysis. However, unlike the classic {AZT} resistance mutations ({M41L/D67N/K70R/T215Y} or {F/K219E} or Q), the combination of the amino acid insertions in the fingers and the {T215Y} mutation allows efficient excision of {ddTMP} and {d4TMP}, even when relatively high levels of deoxynucleoside triphosphates are present in the reaction. Although the dideoxynucleoside analogs of other nucleosides were excised more slowly than {AZTMP}, {ddTMP}, and {d4TMP}, the mutants with the fingers insertion and {T215Y} excised all of the nucleoside analogs that were tested more efficiently than wild-type {RT} or a mutant {RT} carrying the classical {AZT} resistance mutations. In the ternary complex ({RT/template-primer/dNTP)}, the presence of the bound {dNTP} prevents the end of the primer from gaining access to the nucleotide binding site (N site) where excision occurs. Gel shift analysis showed that the amino acid insertions in the fingers destabilized the ternary complex compared to wild-type {HIV-1} {RT.} If the ternary complex is unstable, the end of the primer can gain access to the N site and excision can occur. This could explain the enhanced excision of the nucleoside analogs.},

	abstract = {Zidovudine-resistant strains of {HIV} became apparent in many patients soon after advent of zidovudine ({AZT)} monotherapy. While this resistance could be unequivocally correlated with multiple mutations in {HIV} reverse transcriptase ({D67N}, {K70R}, {T215F/Y}, {K219Q)}, the mechanism or phenotype for this resistance has remained obscure for more than a decade, despite active investigation. Recent studies indicate that {AZT} resistance may be related to removal of chain-terminating {AZT} from the 3′-terminus of the primer, by a process known as pyrophosphorolysis. This process is catalyzed by {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)}, and is the reverse reaction of {DNA} polymerization. The {D67N/K70R} mutations result in a significantly increased rate of {RT-catalyzed} pyrophosphorolysis at physiological levels of pyrophosphate, which leads to a decrease in the extent of {AZT} chain termination of nascent viral {DNA.} The potential replication deficit of an increased reverse reaction during {DNA} synthesis is compensated by increased {DNA} synthesis processivity, a phenotype that results from the {T215F/Y/K219Q} mutations in {RT.} The net result of these multiple phenotypes imparted by the multiple mutations in {RT} is the facile synthesis of full-length viral {DNA} in the presence of {AZT.}},

We show that mutant {RT} has increased ability to remove {AZTMP} from blocked primers through a nucleotide-dependent reaction, producing dinucleoside polyphosphate and extendible primer. In the presence of physiological concentrations of {ATP}, mutant {RT} extended 12\% to 15\% of primers past multiple {AZTMP} termination sites versus less than 0.5\% for wild type. Although mutant {RT} also unblocked {ddAMP-terminated} primers more efficiently than wild-type {RT}, the removal of {ddAMP} was effectively inhibited by the next complementary {dNTP} ({IC50} ≈ 12 {μM).} In contrast, the removal of {AZTMP} was not inhibited by {dNTPs} except at nonphysiological concentrations ({IC50} \&gt; 200 {μM).}},

Recombinant virus carrying this variant {RT} (termed {SS} {RT)} showed reduced susceptibility to all nucleoside {RT} inhibitors in clinical use, particularly to {AZT.} In the presence of {ATP}, recombinant {SS} {RT} had an increased ability to remove the 3'-terminal nucleotide from {AZT-} terminated primers and extend the unblocked primer, compared with wild-type {HIV-1} {RT} ({BH10} isolate). Insertion of two serines in the sequence context of {BH10} {RT} did not affect the {ATP-dependent} phosphorolytic activity of the enzyme, and had no influence in resistance to {RT} inhibitors. However, {SS} {RT} mutants lacking the dipeptide insertion or bearing a four-serine insertion showed reduced {ATP-dependent} phosphorolytic activity that correlated with increased {AZT} sensitivity, as determined using a recombinant virus assay.

	abstract = {Two distinct mechanisms can be envisioned for resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} to nucleoside analogs: one in which the mutations interfere with the ability of {HIV-1} {RT} to incorporate the analog, and the other in which the mutations enhance the excision of the analog after it has been incorporated. It has been clear for some time that there are mutations that selectively interfere with the incorporation of nucleoside analogs; however, it has only recently been proposed that zidovudine ({AZT)} resistance can involve the excision of the nucleoside analog after it has been incorporated into viral {DNA.} Although this proposal resolves some important issues, it leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, how do the {AZT} resistance mutations enhance excision, and what mechanism(s) causes the excision reaction to be relatively specific for {AZT?} We have used both structural and biochemical data to develop a model. In this model, several of the mutations associated with {AZT} resistance act primarily to enhance the binding of {ATP}, which is the most likely pyrophosphate donor in the in vivo excision reaction. The {AZT} resistance mutations serve to increase the affinity of {RT} for {ATP} so that, at physiological {ATP} concentrations, excision is reasonably efficient. So far as we can determine, the specificity of the excision reaction for an {AZT-terminated} primer is not due to the mutations that confer resistance, but depends instead on the structure of the region around the {HIV-1} {RT} polymerase active site and on its interactions with the azido group of {AZT.} Steric constraints involving the azido group cause the end of an {AZT} 5′-monophosphate-terminated primer to preferentially reside at the nucleotide binding site, which favors excision.},

Starting from the {HEPT} and {TIBO} derivatives, more than thirty structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as {NNRTIs}, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to {HIV-1} replication and targeted at the {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT).} Two {NNRTIs} (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are (or have been) in preclinical and/or clinical development [tivirapine ({TIBO} R-86183), loviride (α-{APA} R89439), thiocarboxanilide {UC-781}, {HEPT} derivative {MKC-442}, quinoxaline {HBY} 097, {DMP} 266 (efavirenz), {PETT} derivatives (trovirdine, {PETT-4}, {PETT-5)} and the dichlorophenylthio(pyridyl)imidazole derivative S-1153]. The {NNRTIs} interact with a specific ‘pocket’ site of {HIV-1} {RT} that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the {NRTI} binding site. {NNRTIs} are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the {NNRTI-binding} site. However, the emergence of resistant {HIV} strains can be circumvented if the {NNRTIs}, preferably in combination with other anti-{HIV} agents, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has been shown to ‘knock-out’ virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations containing {NNRTIs}, {NRTIs} and/or {PIs} may result in an effective viral suppression and ensuing immune recovery. However, this so-called {HAART} (highly active antiretroviral therapy) may also fail, and this necessitates the design of new and more effective drugs and drug cocktails.},

However, the development of drug resistance leads to the emergence of {HIV} strains that are resistant to multiple anti-{AIDS} drugs. The nucleotide analogs that are used as anti-{HIV-1} drugs lack the normal 3′-{OH} and as a consequence act as chain-terminators when incorporated into {DNA.} One mechanism of nucleoside analog resistance involves {ATP-based} excision to unblock chain-terminated primers and allow {HIV} replication to continue. There is an urgent need for new drugs and for new therapies that can overcome the excision mechanism of resistance. Compounds that disrupt the binding of the excision reaction substrate(s) (the blocked primer and/or {ATP} and/or pyrophosphate), or mimic the dinucleoside tetraphosphate product of the {ATP-based} excision reaction are potential inhibitors of excision. Detailed understanding of drug resistance mechanisms can reveal novel targets for anti-viral agents.},

	abstract = {Mutations at either Tyr181 or Tyr188 within {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)} give high level resistance to many first generation non-nucleoside inhibitors ({NNRTIs)} such as the anti-{AIDS} drug nevirapine. By comparison second generation inhibitors, for instance the drug efavirenz, show much greater resilience to these mutations. In order to understand the structural basis for these differences we have determined a series of seven crystal structures of mutant {RTs} in complexes with first and second generation {NNRTIs} as well as one example of an unliganded mutant {RT.} These are {Tyr181Cys} {RT} ({TNK-651)} to 2.4 Å, {Tyr181Cys} {RT} (efavirenz) to 2.6 Å, {Tyr181Cys} {RT} (nevirapine) to 3.0 Å, {Tyr181Cys} {RT} ({PETT-2)} to 3.0 Å, {Tyr188Cys} {RT} (nevirapine) to 2.6 Å, {Tyr188Cys} {RT} ({UC-781)} to 2.6 Å and {Tyr188Cys} {RT} (unliganded) to 2.8 Å resolution. In the two previously published structures of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase with mutations at 181 or 188 no side-chain electron density was observed within the p66 subunit (which contains the inhibitor binding pocket) for the mutated residues. In contrast the mutated side-chains can be seen in the {NNRTI} pocket for all seven structures reported here, eliminating the possibility that disordering contributes to the mechanism of resistance. In the case of the second generation compounds efavirenz with {Tyr181Cys} {RT} and {UC-781} with {Tyr188Cys} {RT} there are only small rearrangements of either inhibitor within the binding site compared to wild-type {RT} and also for the first generation compounds {TNK-651}, {PETT-2} and nevirapine with {Tyr181Cys} {RT.} For nevirapine with the {Tyr188Cys} {RT} there is however a more substantial movement of the drug molecule. We conclude that protein conformational changes and rearrangements of drug molecules within the mutated sites are not general features of these particular inhibitor/mutant combinations. The main contribution to drug resistance for {Tyr181Cys} and {Tyr188Cys} {RT} mutations is the loss of aromatic ring stacking interactions for first generation compounds, providing a simple explanation for the resilience of second generation {NNRTIs}, as such interactions make much less significant contribution to their binding.

Foscarnet and its analogues achieve their antiviral effects via inhibition of viral polymerases, with such inhibition not being dependent on activation or phosphorylation of the compounds by viral or cellular proteins. Current evidence indicates that foscarnet interferes with exchange of pyrophosphate from deoxynucleoside triphosphate during viral replication by binding to a site on the herpesvirus {DNA} polymerase or {HIV} reverse transcriptase. Reviewed herein are basic findings regarding the mechanism of action and antiviral activity of foscarnet and the related compound phosphonoacetic acid ({PAA)}, as well as findings regarding potential mechanisms of viral resistance and interactions with other antiviral agents.},

	abstract = {Foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid) is a pyrophosphate analog that inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} in vitro and in patients with {AIDS.} {HIV-1} resistance to foscarnet has not been reported despite long-term foscarnet therapy of {AIDS} patients with cytomegalovirus disease. We therefore attempted to select foscarnet-resistant {HIV-1} in vitro by serial endpoint passage of virus in 400 {microM} foscarnet. After 13 cycles of passage in {MT-2} cells, virus exhibiting {\textgreater} or = 8.5-fold foscarnet resistance was isolated. The reverse transcriptase ({RT)} from resistant virions exhibited a similar level of foscarnet resistance in enzyme inhibition assays (approximately 10-fold resistance). Foscarnet-resistant virus showed increased susceptibility to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (90-fold) and to the {HIV-1-specific} {RT} inhibitors {TIBO} R82150 (30-fold) and nevirapine (20-fold). {DNA} sequence analysis of {RT} clones from resistant virus revealed the coexistence of two mutations in all clones: Gln-161 to Leu ({CAA} to {CTA)} and His-208 to Tyr ({CAT} to {TAT).} Sequence analysis of six clinical {HIV-1} isolates showing reduced susceptibility to foscarnet revealed the Tyr-208 mutation in two, the Leu-161 mutation in one, and a Trp-88-to-Ser or -Gly mutation in four isolates. Site-specific mutagenesis and production of mutant recombinant viruses demonstrated that the Leu-161, Ser-88, and Tyr-208 mutations reduced {HIV-1} susceptibility to foscarnet 10.5-, 4.3-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, in {MT-2} cells. In the crystal structure of {HIV-1} {RT}, the Gln-161 residue lies in the alpha E helix beneath the putative deoxynucleoside triphosphate ({dNTP)} binding site. The Gln-161-to-Leu mutation may affect the structure of the {dNTP} binding site and its affinity for foscarnet. The location of the Trp-88 residue in the Beta5a strand of {HIV-1} {RT} suggest that the Ser-88 mutation affects template-primer binding, as do several mutations that affect {RT} susceptibility to nucleoside analogs.},

The discovery and development of human immunodeficiency virus-1 ({HIV-1)} protease inhibitors demonstrated a new paradigm for drug discovery and may be one of the first examples of this paradigm to come to fruition. In particular, the power of molecular and structural biology applied to the drug discovery effort was convincingly demonstrated Initiating human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} protease inhibitors with dual nucleosides represents the most important treatment development for persons with {HIV} infection. These inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk for disease progression and death for persons with advanced immune suppression (less than 200 {CD4} cells). Clinicians must educate patients regarding the risk and benefit for initiating t this complex therapy and be responsible for selecting a combination that will maximally suppress viral replication. Therapy with {HIV-1} protease inhibitor and dual nucleosides may represent the most active combination. Expert clinicians and patients must also balance toxicity, convenience, and adherence with the known beneficial activity associated with {HIV-1} protease inhibitors.},

	abstract = {Two different responses to the therapy were observed in a group of patients receiving the protease inhibitor indinavir. In one, suppression of virus replication occurred and has persisted for 90 weeks ({bDNA}, {\textless} 500 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [{HIV-1]} {RNA} copies/ml). In the second group, a rebound in virus levels in plasma followed the initial sharp decline observed at the start of therapy. This was associated with the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Sequence analysis of the protease gene during the course of therapy revealed that in this second group there was a sequential acquisition of protease mutations at amino acids 46, 82, 54, 71, 89, and 90. In the six patients in this group, there was also an identical mutation in the gag p7/p1 gag protease cleavage site. In three of the patients, this change was seen as early as 6 to 10 weeks after the start of therapy. In one patient, a second mutation occurred at the gag p1/p6 cleavage site, but it appeared 18 weeks after the time of appearance of the p7/p1 mutation. Recombinant {HIV-1} variants containing two or three mutations in the protease gene were constructed either with mutations at the p7/p1 cleavage site or with wild-type ({WT)} gag sequences. When recombinant {HIV-1-containing} protease mutations at 46 and 82 was grown in {MT2} cells, there was a 68\% reduction in its rate of replication compared to the {WT} virus. Introduction of an additional mutation at the gag p7/p1 protease cleavage site compensated for the partially defective protease gene. Similarly, rates of replication of viruses with mutations {M46L/I}, {I54V}, and {V82A} in protease were enhanced both in the presence and in the absence of Indinavir when combined with mutations in the gag p7/p1 and the gag p1/p6 cleavage sites. Optimal rates of virus replication require protease cleavage of precursor polyproteins. A mutation in the cleavage site that enhanced the availability of a protein that was rate limiting for virus maturation would confer on that virus a significant growth advantage and may explain the uniform emergence of viruses with alterations at the p7/p1 cleavage site. This is the first report of the emergence of mutations in the gag p7/p1 protease cleavage sites in patients receiving protease therapy and identifies this change as an important determinant of {HIV-1} resistance to protease inhibitors in patient populations.},

Two additional {INIs} in advanced clinical development—elvitegravir and {S/GSK1349572—may} prove equally versatile.

The {RT-RNase} H-{IN} region was {PCR} amplified from plasma viral {RNA} obtained from 49 {HIV-1} subtype B-infected patients (21 drug naïve and 28 failing highly active antiretroviral therapy [{HAART]} not containing {InSTIs)} and recombined with an {HXB2-based} backbone with {RT} and {IN} deleted. Recombinant viruses were tested against raltegravir and elvitegravir and for replication capacity. Three-hundred forty-four recombinant viruses from 49 patients were successfully analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically. The majority of clones were not phenotypically resistant to {InSTIs:} 0/344 clones showed raltegravir resistance, and only 3 (0.87\%) showed low-level elvitegravir resistance. No primary resistance mutations for raltegravir and elvitegravir were found as major or minor species. The majority of secondary mutations were also absent or rarely present. Secondary mutations, such as {T97A} and {G140S}, found rarely and only as minority quasispecies, were present in the elvitegravir-resistant clones. A novel mutation, {E92G}, although rarely found in minority quasispecies, showed elvitegravir resistance. Preexisting genotypic and phenotypic raltegravir resistance was extremely rare in {InSTI-naïve} patients and confined to only a restricted minority of secondary variants. Overall, these results, together with others based on population and ultradeep sequencing, suggest that at this point {IN} genotyping in all patients before raltegravir treatment may not be cost-effective and should not be recommended until evidence of transmitted drug resistance to {InSTIs} or the clinical relevance of {IN} minor variants/polymorphisms is determined.},

	abstract = {The increasing incidence of resistance to current {HIV-1} therapy underscores the need to develop antiretroviral agents with new mechanisms of action. Integrase, one of three viral enzymes essential for {HIV-1} replication, presents an important yet unexploited opportunity for drug development. We describe here the identification and characterization of L-870,810, a small-molecule inhibitor of {HIV-1} integrase with potent antiviral activity in cell culture and good pharmacokinetic properties. L-870,810 is an inhibitor with an 8-hydroxy-(1,6)-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide pharmacophore. The compound inhibits {HIV-1} integrase-mediated strand transfer, and its antiviral activity in vitro is a direct consequence of this ascribed effect on integration. L-870,810 is mechanistically identical to previously described inhibitors from the diketo acid series; however, viruses selected for resistance to L-870,810 contain mutations (integrase residues 72, 121, and 125) that uniquely confer resistance to the naphthyridine. Conversely, mutations associated with resistance to the diketo acid do not engender naphthyridine resistance. Importantly, the mutations associated with resistance to each of these inhibitors map to distinct regions within the integrase active site. Therefore, we propose a model of the two inhibitors that is consistent with this observation and suggests specific interactions with discrete binding sites for each ligand. These studies provide a structural basis and rationale for developing integrase inhibitors with the potential for unique and nonoverlapping resistance profiles.},

	abstract = {The diketo acid L-708,906 has been reported to be a selective inhibitor of the strand transfer step of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} integration process (D. Hazuda, P. Felock, M. Witmer, A. Wolfe, K. Stillmock, J. A. Grobler, A. Espeseth, L. Gabryelski, W. Schleif, C. Blau, and M. D. Miller, Science 287:646-650, 2000). We have now studied the development of antiviral resistance to L-708,906 by growing {HIV-1} strains in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compound. The mutations {T66I}, {L74M}, and {S230R} emerged successively in the integrase gene. The virus with three mutations ({T66I} {L74M} {S230R)} was 10-fold less susceptible to L-708,906, while displaying the sensitivity of the wild-type virus to inhibitors of the {RT} or {PRO} or viral entry process. Chimeric {HIV-1} strains containing the mutant integrase genes displayed the same resistance profile as the in vitro-selected strains, corroborating the impact of the reported mutations on the resistance phenotype. Phenotypic cross-resistance to S-1360, a diketo analogue in clinical trials, was observed for all strains. Interestingly, the diketo acid-resistant strain remained fully sensitive to V-165, a novel integrase inhibitor (C. Pannecouque, W. Pluymers, B. Van Maele, V. Tetz, P. Cherepanov, E. De Clercq, M. Witvrouw, and Z. Debyser, Curr. Biol. 12:1169-1177, 2002). Antiviral resistance was also studied at the level of recombinant integrase. Single mutations did not appear to impair specific enzymatic activity. However, 3′ processing and strand transfer activities of the recombinant integrases with two ({T66I} {L74M)} and three ({T66I} {L74M} {S230R)} mutations were notably lower than those of the wild-type integrase. Although the virus with three mutations was resistant to inhibition by diketo acids, the sensitivity of the corresponding enzyme to L-708,906 or S-1360 was reduced only two- to threefold. As to the replication kinetics of the selected strains, the replication fitness for all strains was lower than that of the wild-type {HIV-1} strain.},

The number of cases reported in 1985 more than doubled those reported in 1984. The major risk factors in children for acquiring infection with the causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)}, were (1) having a mother known to be infected and/or at increased risk for infection and (2) receiving a transfusion of blood or blood products. Of the 307 children with {AIDS}, 73\% were reported from one of four states: New York, New Jersey, Florida, and California. Most {AIDS} cases in children occur in black or Hispanic infants and toddlers. The estimated incubation period for {AIDS} in children has increased each surveillance year, with the longest incubation exceeding 7 years. The prognosis for children with {AIDS} is poor and infants less than 1 year of age have the shortest survival time following diagnosis. Continued national surveillance for {AIDS} is mandatory for establishing effective prevention programs to control the spread of the disease. The {CDC} encourages all health care personnel to report cases of {AIDS} to their public health departments.},

Although many of the molecular processes involved in viral attachment and entry have been resolved, the population dynamical mechanisms leading to the emergence of {CXCR4-using} {HIV} variants in some infected individuals are not yet understood.

Here, we describe some properties of clonal viruses resistant to one such inhibitor, {SCH-D}, using both chimeric, infectious molecular clones and Env-pseudotypes. Studies using combinations of {CCR5} ligands, including small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies ({MAbs)} and chemokine derivatives such as {PSC-RANTES}, show that the fully {SCH-D-resistant} viruses enter target cells by using the {SCH-D-bound} form of {CCR5.} However, the way resistance to {SCH-D} and other small molecule {CCR5} inhibitors is manifested depends on the target cell and the nature of the assay (single- vs. multi-cycle). In multi-cycle assays using primary lymphocytes, {SCH-D} does not inhibit resistant molecular clones, and it can even enhance their infectivity modestly. In contrast, the same viruses (as Env-pseudotypes) are significantly inhibited by {SCH-D} in single-cycle entry assays using U87-{CD4/CCR5} cells, resistance being manifested by incomplete inhibition at high {SCH-D} concentrations. When a single-cycle, Env-pseudotype entry assay was performed using either U87-{CD4/CCR5} cells or {PBMC} under comparable conditions, entry was inhibited by up to 88\% in the former cells but by only 28\% in the {PBMC.} Hence, there are both cell- and assay-dependent influences on how resistance is manifested. We also take this opportunity to correct our previous report that {SCH-D-resistant} isolates are also substantially cross-resistant to {PSC-RANTES} [Marozsan, {A.J.}, Kuhmann, {S.E.}, Morgan, T., Herrera, C., Rivera-Troche, E., Xu, S., Baroudy, {B.M.}, Strizki, J., Moore, {J.P.}, 2005.

	abstract = {Maraviroc is a {CCR5} antagonist in clinical development as one of a new class of antiretrovirals targeting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} coreceptor binding. We investigated the mechanism of {HIV} resistance to maraviroc by using in vitro sequential passage and site-directed mutagenesis. Serial passage through increasing maraviroc concentrations failed to select maraviroc-resistant variants from some laboratory-adapted and clinical isolates of {HIV-1.} However, high-level resistance to maraviroc was selected from three of six primary isolates passaged in peripheral blood lymphocytes ({PBL).} The {SF162} strain acquired resistance to maraviroc in both treated and control cultures; all resistant variants were able to use {CXCR4} as a coreceptor. In contrast, maraviroc-resistant virus derived from isolates {CC1/85} and {RU570} remained {CCR5} tropic, as evidenced by susceptibility to the {CCR5} antagonist {SCH-C}, resistance to the {CXCR4} antagonist {AMD3100}, and an inability to replicate in {CCR5} Δ32/Δ32 {PBL.} Strain-specific mutations were identified in the V3 loop of maraviroc-resistant {CC1/85} and {RU570.} The envelope-encoding region of maraviroc-resistant {CC1/85} was inserted into an {NL4-3} background. This recombinant virus was completely resistant to maraviroc but retained susceptibility to aplaviroc. Reverse mutation of gp120 residues 316 and 323 in the V3 loop (numbering from {HXB2)} to their original sequence restored wild-type susceptibility to maraviroc, while reversion of either mutation resulted in a partially sensitive virus with reduced maximal inhibition (plateau). The plateaus are consistent with the virus having acquired the ability to utilize maraviroc-bound receptor for entry. This hypothesis was further corroborated by the observation that a high concentration of maraviroc blocks the activity of aplaviroc against maraviroc-resistant virus.},

Trkola, S. E. Kuhmann, J. M. Strizki, E. Maxwell, T. Ketas, T. Morgan, P. Pugach, S. X. L. Wojcik, J. Tagat, A. Palani, S. Shapiro, J. W. Clader, S. {McCombie}, G. R. Reyes, B. M. Baroudy, and J. P. Moore, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 99:395-400, 2002). The escape mutant, {CC101.19}, continued to use {CCR5} for entry, but it was at least 20,000-fold more resistant to {AD101} than the parental virus, {CC1/85.} We have now cloned the env genes from the the parental and escape mutant isolates and made chimeric infectious molecular clones that fully recapitulate the phenotypes of the corresponding isolates. Sequence analysis of the evolution of the escape mutants suggested that the most relevant changes were likely to be in the V3 loop of the gp120 glycoprotein. We therefore made a series of mutant viruses and found that full {AD101} resistance was conferred by four amino acid changes in V3. Each change individually caused partial resistance when they were introduced into the V3 loop of a {CC1/85} clone, but their impact was dependent on the gp120 context in which they were made. We assume that these amino acid changes alter how the {HIV-1} Env complex interacts with {CCR5.} Perhaps unexpectedly, given the complete dependence of the escape mutant on {CCR5} for entry, monomeric gp120 proteins expressed from clones of the fully resistant isolate failed to bind to {CCR5} on the surface of L1.2-{CCR5} cells under conditions where gp120 proteins from the parental virus and a partially {AD101-resistant} virus bound strongly. Hence, the full impact of the V3 substitutions may only be apparent at the level of the native Env complex.},

	abstract = {Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} viruses in the brain use {CCR5} as the principal coreceptor for entry into a cell. However, additional phenotypic characteristics are necessary for {HIV-1} neurotropism. Furthermore, neurotropic strains are not necessarily neurovirulent. To better understand the determinants of {HIV-1} neurovirulence, we isolated viruses from brain tissue samples from three {AIDS} patients with dementia and {HIV-1} encephalitis and analyzed their ability to induce syncytia in monocyte-derived macrophages ({MDM)} and neuronal apoptosis in primary brain cultures. Two {R5X4} viruses ({MACS1-br} and {MACS1-spln)} were highly fusogenic in {MDM} and induced neuronal apoptosis. The R5 viruses {UK1-br} and {MACS2-br} are both neurotropic. However, only {UK1-br} induced high levels of fusion in {MDM} and neuronal apoptosis. Full-length Env clones from {UK1-br} required lower {CCR5} and {CD4} levels than Env clones from {MACS2-br} to function efficiently in cell-to-cell fusion and single-round infection assays. {UK1-br} Envs also had a greater affinity for {CCR5} than {MACS2-br} Envs in binding assays. Relatively high levels of {UK1-br} and {MACS2-br} Envs bound to {CCR5} in the absence of soluble {CD4.} However, these Envs could not mediate {CD4-independent} infection, and {MACS2-br} Envs were unable to mediate fusion or infection in cells expressing low levels of {CD4.} The {UK1-br} virus was more resistant than {MACS2-br} to inhibition by the {CCR5-targeted} inhibitors {TAK-779} and Sch-C. {UK1-br} was more sensitive than {MACS2-br} to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies ({2F5} and immunoglobulin G1b12 [{IgG1b12])} and {CD4-IgG2.} These results predict the presence of {HIV-1} variants with increased {CCR5} affinity and reduced dependence on {CCR5} and {CD4} in the brains of some {AIDS} patients with central nervous system disease and suggest that R5 variants with increased {CCR5} affinity may represent a pathogenic viral phenotype contributing to the neurodegenerative manifestations of {AIDS.}},

A {CD4-induced} surface on gp120, primarily composed of residues in the V3 loop and the C4 domain, interacts with {CCR5.} In the present study, we generated envelope glycoproteins comprising chimeric V3 loops and/or V3 loops with deletions and studied their binding to {CCR5} amino-terminal domain (Nt)-based sulfopeptides and cell surface {CCR5}, as well as their ability to mediate viral entry. We thus delineated two functionally distinct domains of the V3 loop, the V3 stem and the V3 crown. The V3 stem alone mediates soluble gp120 binding to the {CCR5} Nt. In contrast, both the V3 stem and crown are required for soluble gp120 binding to cell surface {CCR5.} Within the context of a virion, however, the V3 crown alone determines coreceptor usage. Our data support a two-site gp120-{CCR5} binding model wherein the V3 crown and stem interact with distinct regions of {CCR5} in order to mediate viral entry.},

We applied nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic techniques to analyze the structure of the {CCR5} N terminus and that of the tyrosine-sulfated antibody 412d in complex with gp120 and {CD4.} The conformations of tyrosine-sulfated regions of {CCR5} (α-helix) and 412d (extended loop) are surprisingly different.

	abstract = {The rapid replication rate of {HIV-1} {RNA} and its inherent genetic variation have led to the production of many {HIV-1} variants with decreased drug susceptibility. The capacity of {HIV} to develop drug resistance mutations is a major obstacle to long-term effective anti-{HIV} therapy. Incomplete suppression of viral replication with an initial drug regimen diminishes the clinical benefit to the patient and may promote the development of broader drug resistance that may cause subsequent treatment regimens to be ineffective. The increased clinical use of combination antiretroviral treatment for {HIV-1} infection has led to the selection of viral strains resistant to multiple drugs, including strains resistant to all licensed nucleoside analog {RT} inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of such mutations on viral properties such as replicative fitness, fidelity, and mutation rates. Although research continues to improve our understanding of resistance, leading to refined treatment strategies and, in some cases, improved outcome, resistance to antiretroviral therapy remains a major cause of treatment failure among patients living with {HIV-1.}},

	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of {HIV} isolates resistant to one or multiple antiretroviral drugs has fueled the search for new agents that work by novel mechanisms. Enfuvirtide ({ENF)}, licensed in 2002, is the first marketed antiretroviral ({ARV)} agent that targets viral entry. {ENF} blocks the virus replication cycle by binding to gp41, a critical component of the machinery used by {HIV} to enter host cells. As with all {ARVs}, {HIV} can evolve resistance to {ENF.} However, resistance to {ENF} appears to be somewhat more complex and can derive through either direct or indirect pathways. Direct resistance occurs when mutations in the first heptad repeat of gp41, which constitutes the {ENF-binding} site, reduce {ENF} binding. Indirect resistance is not attributable to changes in the {ENF-binding} site per se, but rather to changes in the {HIV} envelope glycoprotein (gp120) that reduce {ENF} susceptibility by more complex mechanisms. The extensive gp120 amino-acid sequence heterogeneity found in primary viral isolates results in unusually broad variability in susceptibility to {ENF}, and indeed to other classes of {HIV} entry inhibitors. Clinical data reported to date do not provide clear evidence that virological outcome of {ENF} therapy can be predicted by either genotypic or phenotypic analysis of viruses present in patients at initiation of {ENF} therapy. Although {ENF} offers an exciting opportunity to treat multi-drug resistant {HIV}, these observations suggest a greater understanding of {ENF} resistance may be required to ensure the most effective use of {ENF} in infected patients. Many aspects of the complexities observed in {ENF} resistance are likely to be relevant for other classes of {HIV} entry inhibitors currently in development.},

Once {NRTIs} are incorporated into the nascent viral {DNA}, in reactions catalyzed by {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)}, further viral {DNA} synthesis is effectively terminated. {NRTIs} should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, {HIV-1} inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in {RT.} To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for {HIV-1} {RT} resistance to {NRTIs.} These mechanisms include alterations of {RT} discrimination between {NRTIs} and the analogous {dNTP} (direct effects on {NRTI} binding and/or incorporation), alterations in {RT-template/primer} interactions, which may influence subsequent {NRTI} incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in {RT.} This review discusses the relationship between {HIV-1} drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of {HIV-1} {RT} structure.},

In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of this peptide, we derived resistant variants of {HIV-1IIIB} and {NL4-3} by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of the peptide. Sequence analysis of the resistant isolates suggested that a contiguous 3-amino-acid sequence within the amino-terminal heptad repeat motif of gp41 was associated with resistance. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed this observation and indicated that changes in two of these three residues were necessary for development of the resistant phenotype. Direct binding of {DP178} to recombinant protein and synthetic peptide analogs containing the wild-type and mutant heptad repeat sequences revealed a strong correlation between {DP178} binding and the biological sensitivity of the corresponding virus isolates to {DP178.} The results are discussed from the standpoints of the mechanism of action of {DP178} and recent crystallographic information for a core structure of the gp41 ectodomain.},

	abstract = {The synthetic peptide T-20 (enfuvirtide) represents the first of a new class of antiretroviral compounds to demonstrate in vivo potency by targeting a step in viral entry. T-20 inhibits a conformational change in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) that is required for fusion between {HIV-1} and target cell membranes. The initial phase I clinical trial of T-20 treatment for {HIV-infected} patients thus provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of resistant virus in vivo to this novel class of antiretroviral agents. All four patients who received an intermediate dose of T-20 (30 mg twice daily) had an initial decline in plasma viral load over the first 10 days but a rising trend by day 14, suggestive of selection for resistant virus. Plasma virus derived from patients enrolled in all dosage groups of the phase I T-20 trial was analyzed by population sequencing before and after treatment. While no mutations were found within a highly conserved 3-amino-acid sequence ({GIV)} known to be critical for fusion at baseline, after 14 days of therapy, virus from one patient in the 30-mg dose group (30-1) developed a mutation in this motif, specifically an aspartic acid (D) substitution for glycine (G) at position 36. Multiple env clones were derived from the plasma virus of all four patients in the 30-mg dosage group. Sequence analysis of 49 clones derived from the plasma of patient 30-1 on day 14 revealed that 25 clones contained the {G36D} mutation, while 8 contained the {V38A} mutation. Dual mutations involving {G36D} and other residues within the {HR1} domain were also identified. In 5 of the 49 env clones, other mutations involving residues 32 ({Q32R} or {Q32H)} and 39 ({Q39R)} were found in combination with {G36D.} Cloned env sequences derived from the plasma virus of subject 30-3 also had single mutations in the {GIV} sequence ({V38M} and {I37V)} detectable following therapy with T-20. The plasma virus from subjects 30-2 and 30-4 did not contain changes within the {GIV} sequence. To analyze the biological resistance properties of these mutations, we developed a novel single-cycle {HIV-1} entry assay using {JC53BL} cells which express β-galactosidase and luciferase under control of the {HIV-1} long terminal repeat. Full-length env clones were derived from the plasma virus of patients 30-1 and 30-3 and used to generate pseudotyped virus stocks. The mean 50\% inhibition concentrations ({IC50s)} for mutants {G36D} and {V38A} (patient 30-1) were 2.3 μg/ml and 11.2 μg/ml, respectively, statistically significant increases of 9.1- and 45-fold, respectively, compared with those of wild-type Env. The {IC50} for the V38 M mutation (patient 30-3) was 7.6 μg/ml, an 8-fold increase compared with that of the wild type. The {I37V} mutation resulted in an {IC50} 3.2-fold greater than that of the wild type. Envs with double mutations ({Q32R} plus {G36D} and {Q32H} plus {G36D)} exhibited a level of resistance similar to that of {G36D} alone. These findings provide the first evidence for the rapid emergence of clinical resistance to a novel class of {HIV-1} entry inhibitors and may be relevant to future treatment strategies involving these agents.},

	abstract = {{HIV} entry inhibitors include coreceptor antagonists and the fusion inhibitor T-20. T-20 binds the first helical region ({HR1)} in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) protein and prevents conformational changes required for membrane fusion. {HR1} appears to become accessible to T-20 after Env binds {CD4}, whereas coreceptor binding is thought to induce the final conformational changes that lead to membrane fusion. Thus, T-20 binds to a structural intermediate of the fusion process. Primary viruses exhibit considerable variability in T-20 sensitivity, and determinants outside of {HR1} can affect sensitivity by unknown mechanisms. We studied chimeric Env proteins containing different V3 loop sequences and found that gp120/coreceptor affinity correlated with T-20 and coreceptor antagonist sensitivity, with greater affinity resulting in increased resistance to both classes of entry inhibitors. Enhanced affinity resulted in more rapid fusion kinetics, reducing the time during which Env is sensitive to T-20. Reduced coreceptor expression levels also delayed fusion kinetics and enhanced virus sensitivity to T-20, whereas increased coreceptor levels had the opposite effect. A single amino acid change ({K421D)} in the bridging sheet region of the primary virus strain {YU2} reduced affinity for {CCR5} and increased T-20 sensitivity by about 30-fold. Thus, mutations in Env that affect receptor engagement and membrane fusion rates can alter entry inhibitor sensitivity. Because coreceptor expression levels are typically limiting in vivo, individuals who express lower coreceptor levels may respond more favorably to entry inhibitors such as T-20, whose effectiveness we show depends in part on fusion kinetics.},

Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of individual {HIV-1} virus-like particles ({VLPs)} as obtained by electron cryotomography. These reconstructions revealed that while the structures and positions of the conical cores within each {VLP} were unique, they exhibited several surprisingly consistent features, including similarities in the size and shape of the wide end of the capsid (the “base”), uniform positioning of the base and other regions of the capsid 11 nm away from the {envelope/MA} layer, a cone angle that typically varied from 24° to 18° around the long axis of the cone, and an internal density (presumably part of the {NC/RNA} complex) cupped within the base. Multiple and nested capsids were observed. These results support the fullerene cone model for the viral capsid, indicate that viral maturation involves a free re-organization of the capsid shell rather than a continuous condensation, imply that capsid assembly is both concentration-driven and template-driven, suggest that specific interactions exist between the capsid and the adjacent {envelope/MA} and {NC/RNA} layers, and show that a particular capsid shape is favored strongly in-vivo.},

The crystal structure of chemically synthesized {HIV-1} protease has been determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution (R factor of 0.184) with the use of a model based on the Rous sarcoma virus protease structure. In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.},

These studies included nine clinical trials and three observational cohorts. The primary end-point in our analyses was virological failure by week 24. Baseline factors that were investigated as predictors of virological failure were plasma {HIV-1} {RNA}, the number and type of new antiretroviral drugs in the regimen, and viral susceptibility to the drugs in the regimen, determined by genotyping or phenotyping methods. These analyses confirmed the importance of both genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance as predictors of virological failure, whether these factors were analysed separately or adjusted for other baseline confounding factors. In most of the re-analysed studies, the odds of virological failure were reduced by about twofold for each additional drug in the regimen to which the patient's virus was sensitive by genotyping methods, and by about two- to threefold for each additional drug that was sensitive by phenotyping.},

Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA}, 90 (1993) 6320]. This report reviews the structure of the reverse transcriptase heterodimer and provides a detailed description of the folding and topology of the individual subdomains. The interactions of the enzyme with bound template- primer are highlighted. Structure-function relationships have been established and are discussed for several conserved sequence motifs located within the enzyme. Each of these motifs is found to interact significantly with template-primer during the polymerization process. This review integrates the findings of both structure determinations, in particular, to relate these structures to strategies for drug design and development. The structures of both the nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitor binding sites are described, and the spatial relationship between the two sites is discussed in light of some novel possibilities for drug development. The first indication of an {HIV-1} {RT} drug-resistant mutation manifested in the p51 subunit is presented. This mutation is located in a region of p51 that is proximal to the nonnucleoside binding pocket. The mechanisms of {HIV-1} {RT} inhibition by both nucleoside and nonnucleoside classes of inhibitors are discussed in relation to the structure of the enzyme. In addition, the implications of the structure for understanding and avoiding the development of resistance of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase to antiviral inhibitors are discussed.},

	volume = {63},
	issn = {0302-6469},
	lccn = {0016},
	abstract = {During recent years significant progress has been made in the treatment of {HIV-1}, at least in part due to the availability of potent antiretroviral drugs. The goal of the current treatment strategies is to inhibit the viral replication as completely as possible by using a combination of 3 or more antiretroviral drugs. This Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ({HAART)} has radically changed the clinical outcome of {HIV}, leading to decreased mortality and morbidity, at least in developed countries. Additionally to the advent of new and potent drugs, demonstrations of the prognostic value of the {CD4} cell count and the plasma viral load were of major importance in the development of therapeutic strategies. Especially the ability of viral load assays to assess accurately the true level of viral replication, led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. {HIV} proved to be a highly dynamic infection even during the period of clinical latency. The initial enthusiasm that {HAART} could radically change the outcome of {HIV} was cooled off in face of the difficulties in real life associated with the complex treatment strategies. Besides long-term side effects and suboptimal drug potency, the emergence of resistant virus and the necessity of perfect therapy adherence are major concerns for obtaining a sustained control of viral replication. In this study we focused on {HIV} resistance, which remains one of the major threats for a sustained response to antiretroviral therapy. {HIV} proved to be able to develop resistance to all currently used antiretroviral drugs. The high replication rate of the virus together with the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase, from the basis for the presence of enormous amounts of viral variants. Whenever viral replication is ongoing in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, these variants that escape the inhibitory effects of the drugs will be selected. Although the knowledge in the field of {HIV} resistance has expanded enormously, many issues need to be answered. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns are evolving continuously, due to changes in the treatment strategies. Moreover the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure needs further investigation, in order to prove the relevance of performing resistance testing in the follow-up of {HIV-infected} patients. The wide availability of antiretroviral drugs has led to the transmission of resistant {HIV.} Infection with {HIV} resistant to one or more antiretroviral drugs has been observed to occur through the different transmission routes. In a first study we assessed the prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Belgian antiretroviral-naïve {HIV-infected} patients. We observed that {HIV} strains with resistance-related mutations to one or more classes of antiretroviral drugs are not uncommon in the Belgian naïve patients. Furthermore the inclusion of samples from patients visiting the Belgian hospitals for the first time in 1995, 1997 and 1998, showed that the overall prevalence of baseline genotypic resistance remains rather constant (26-30\%). The increasing trend in genotypic baseline resistance to {3TC} (2\% to 6.3\%) and {PIs} (4.4\% to 9.9\%) as well as the decrease in {ZDV-resistance} (13.3\% to 5.4\%), reflect the change in treatment strategies, and resistance to these drugs is most probably caused by transmission of variants with resistance mutations selected during therapy. The presence of {NNRTI-related} mutations (around 16\%) is likely to reflect the occurrence of baseline polymorphisms, since {NNRTI-related} mutations can occur without a replication deficit for the virus. Moreover, despite the rather recent introduction of {NNRTIs} into the clinic from 1997 onwards, no clear trend in {NNRTI} baseline resistance over time is observed. The best current therapeutic strategy for {HIV-infected} patients is to start antiretroviral therapy with {HAART} in order to avoid the accumulation of resistance towards drugs in less suppressive regimens. In a second study, we showed that the start of {HAART} in antiretroviral-naive {HIV-patients} in daily clinical practice could prevent viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60\% of patients (n = 25). Six of 10 patients with virologic failure developed resistance to the drugs included in their treatment regimens. In comparison to patients with a sustained virologic response, patients with virologic failure were in a later disease stage when starting therapy and showed lower {PI} drug-levels, what can be an indication of poor adherence. Despite a poor virologic response for some of them, a rise in {CD4} cell count was observed for all patients during the study period. A large number of {HIV-infected} patients started treatment in the pre-{HAART} period. The use of {NRTIs} is mono- or bitherapy was not able to prevent the development of resistant virus. In a third study we studied the prevalence and characteristics of 2 patterns of multinucleoside resistance ({MNR)} in European patients (n = 755). In patients without {NRTI-exposure} or with exposure to only one {NRTI}, no {MNR} was observed. {MNR} was present in low prevalence (each pattern {\textless} 2\%) in patients pretreated with multiple {NRTIs.} Despite this low prevalence, {MNR} should be closely monitored, since it results in broad cross-resistance to {NRTIs} in vitro and a poor therapy response in vivo. We also assessed the predictive value of baseline resistance on the virologic response to later added drugs. The genotype of patients starting or changing a therapy consisting solely of {NRTIs} was analyzed at baseline and 6 months later. In patients without genotypic mutations towards the added drug the virologic response was significantly better compared to patients with baseline resistance. At 6 months however, both patient groups showed a rise in viral load due to the accumulation of {NRTI-related} mutations under the presence of poorly suppressive regimens, although the difference between the two groups remained significant. In this study, and also in studies reported by others, the presence of baseline resistance has a high predictive value for therapy failure, while the absence of resistance is not predictive for therapy response. Suboptimal adherence may be one of the reasons of the poor predictive value of the absence of baseline resistance for a good therapy response. In a last observational study, we investigated the relation between adherence, the presence and development of genotypic resistance and the virologic response in patients during {HAART} therapy. Adherence to 1 protease inhibitor was monitored using Electronic Event Monitoring. Patients with perfect therapy adherence and in particular without drug holidays, can control viral replication provided that the activity of the drugs included in the combination is not entirely compromised by the presence of baseline resistance mutations. In our patient population, reduced adherence resulted in therapy failure, mostly associated with a subsequent accumulation of resistance mutations. In conclusion, the outcome of the {HIV} disease has been revolutionarily changed with the advent of {HAART.} Both resistance and treatment adherence are crucial factors in determining the therapy response. Retrospective studies, such as ours, and a limited number of prospective trials already proved the short-term benefit of therapy switch based on the results of resistance tests in addition to standard of care. To ultimately define the role of tools as resistance testing and adherence monitoring with eventual adherence interventions, more prospective trials are needed as well in treatment-naïve as in experienced patients.},

The presence of a dideoxynucleotide at the 3′-primer terminus allows capture of a state in which the substrates are poised for attack on the {dNTP.} Conformational changes that accompany formation of the catalytic complex produce distinct clusters of the residues that are altered in viruses resistant to nucleoside analog drugs. The positioning of these residues in the neighborhood of the {dNTP} helps to resolve some long-standing puzzles about the molecular basis of resistance. The resistance mutations are likely to influence binding or reactivity of the inhibitors, relative to normal {dNTPs}, and the clustering of the mutations correlates with the chemical structure of the drug.},

Resonances in one-dimensional solid-state {NMR} spectra of uniformly {15N} labeled Vpu are clearly segregated into two bands at chemical shift frequencies associated with {NH} bonds in a transmembrane α-helix, perpendicular to the membrane surface, and with {NH} bonds in the cytoplasmic helices parallel to the membrane surface. Solid-state {NMR} spectra of truncated Vpu2–51 (residues 2–51), which contains the transmembrane α-helix and the first amphipathic helix of the cytoplasmic domain, and of a construct Vpu28–81 (residues 28–81), which contains only the cytoplasmic domain, support this structural model of Vpu in the membrane. Full-length Vpu (residues 2–81) forms discrete ion-conducting channels of heterogeneous conductance in lipid bilayers. The most frequent conductances were 22 ± 3 {pS} and 12 ± 3 {pS} in 0.5 M {KCl} and 29 ± 3 {pS} and 12 ± 3 {pS} in 0.5 M {NaCl.} In agreement with the structural model, truncated Vpu2–51, which has the transmembrane helix, forms discrete channels in lipid bilayers, whereas the cytoplasmic domain Vpu28–81, which lacks the transmembrane helix, does not. This finding shows that the channel activity is associated with the transmembrane helical domain. The pattern of channel activity is characteristic of the self-assembly of conductive oligomers in the membrane and is compatible with the structural and functional findings.},

than development of drug resistance that should be considered are adherence, 
drug potency, and pharmacokinetic issues. Genotypic and phenotypic testing 
for {HIV} resistance to antiretroviral drugs may prove useful for individual 
patient management. Assays under development need validation, standardization, 
and a clearer definition of their clinical roles. Possible current roles of 
resistance testing for choosing an initial regimen or changing antiretroviral 
therapy, as well as possible implications of the presence or absence of phenotypic

	lccn = {0025},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To determine whether genotypic resistance testing leads to selection of more potent drug regimens when compared to regimens based on treatment history only.
{DESIGN:} Prospective, tertiary care centre-based study.
{PATIENTS:} One-hundred-and-forty-five {HIV-infected} adults on stable antiretroviral therapy ({ART)} for {\textgreater}6 months experiencing virological failure.
{METHODS:} The physicians' decision-making process when choosing a salvage regimen was prospectively documented: at time of virological failure, on 'failing {ART'}, genotyping was performed and a hypothetical 'clinical expert {ART'} based upon patient's drug history was documented. Subsequently, data on resistance mutations, rating by a decision support software and drug history were used to define 'genotyping {ART'.} After discussion with the patient, final treatment, 'new personalized {ART'} was chosen and prescribed. To compare the relative potency of the four {ART} regimens in a standardized manner, a resistance score ranging from 1 (best) to 8 (worst) based on drug ranking by decision support software was attributed to each {ART} regimen. Virological and immunological outcomes were analysed based on the magnitude of the resistance score.
{RESULTS:} Median follow-up was 1.5 years. In all 145 patients, median resistance scores for the stepwise selected {ART} regimens were: 'failing {ART':} 4.5, 'clinical expert {ART':} 1.8, 'genotyping {ART':} 1.5 and 'new personalized {ART':} 2. The latter was 1.5 in patients who effectively switched to 'new personalized {ART'} (n=89). Lower resistance scores translated into significantly improved virological response after initiation of 'new personalized {ART'.} In multivariable analysis, lower resistance scores, lower baseline {HIV} {RNA} levels and use of novel antiretroviral drugs were associated with the probability of reducing plasma viraemia to {\textless}50 copies/ml.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This study suggests that treatment choices including genotype and decision support software were virologically superior to those based on drug history only.},

	abstract = {Witness for the prosecution: Assays to detect antiretroviral drug resistance have recently become available, but several factors limit the clinical utility of resistance testing in patients with primary {HIV} infection ({PHI).} First, there is a great uncertainty in the prevalence of {PHI} due to resistant virus, which may vary from 2\% to over 50\%. Moreover, studies on temporal trends give discordant results. Secondly, the reported degree of resistance is also variable since low levels of resistance are reported in some cases. The clinical significance of such low-level baseline reduced susceptibility to some antiretrovirals is uncertain. Thirdly, current resistance testing might not detect minority populations of drug-resistant species. Reversion of mutations conferring drug resistance was described in patients who acquired drug-resistant strains, and viral strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations may become minor species in untreated patients owing to the absence of drug pressure. Finally, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to test the clinical or virological utility of resistance testing in {PHI.} Witness for the defence: A suboptimal initial regimen in subjects infected with drug-resistant virus may be associated with multiple treatment failures in the early stage of the disease and hence with a more rapid disease progression. When treating {PHI}, immediate, complete and long-lasting suppression of virus replication is desired both to limit total body viral burden and to preserve {HIV-1} specific immune responses. Transmission of resistant virus has been identified for each therapeutic class. A greater than 2.5-fold resistance to one or more antiretroviral agent has been observed in 26\% of patients with {PHI} and resistance among newly infected patients has increased over the past 3 y. Treatment should not be delayed to wait for the result of the test. However, once a resistant virus has been identified, one or more drugs can be readily substituted. Prospective randomized studies to address the need for baseline resistance testing in the setting of {PHI} are warranted.},

The variables predicting virological failure (plasma {VL} {\textgreater} 400 {cop/mL)} at 12 months were plasma {VL} {\textgreater} 30,000 {cop/mL} ({OR} 6, 1.8-19.5) and accumulation of 3 or more {TAMs} ({OR} 4.4, 1.3-15) at the start of {ARV} salvage therapy.
{CONCLUSION:} Even though in clinical practice {GRT} is requested for patients with various treatment failures, when {ART} salvage treatment was started, plasma {VL} was undetectable and immunological response persisted in 40\% of patients followed-up for 18 months. The factors best predicting virological evolution were {VL} and the number of baseline {TAMs.}},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To identify predictors of the virological response to antiretroviral therapy in patients in whom initial therapy has failed.
{METHODS:} The Narval trial was designed to compare phenotyping, genotyping and standard of care for the choice of antiretroviral therapy in patients in whom a protease inhibitor ({PI)-containing} regimen had failed. Virological success was defined as viral load below 200 copies/ml at week 12. Baseline variables including demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, {HIV} reverse transcriptase and protease mutations, the randomization arm, the drugs prescribed, as well as adherence to treatment and plasma concentrations of {PIs} and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NNRTIs)} at week 12 were tested in the model. Variables that were significantly associated with virological success in univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model.
{RESULTS:} Five-hundred-and-forty-one patients were randomized. Virological success at week 12 was obtained in 200 patients. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with virological success: prescription of efavirenz to {NNRTI-naive} patients ({OR=4.37;} 95\% {CI:} 2.76-6.90), randomization to the genotyping arm ({OR=2.13}, 1.20-3.79), prescription of lamivudine ({OR=1.69}, 1.01-2.83) and prescription of abacavir to abacavir-naive patients ({OR=1.66}, 1.02-2.72). Factors significantly associated with virological failure were prescription of nelfinavir ({OR=0.30}, 0.13-0.68), a high baseline viral load ({OR=0.37}, 0.28-0.50), the presence of at least five {PI} mutations ({OR=0.42}, 0.26-0.66), the presence of at least three thymidine analogue mutations ({OR=0.61}, 0.39-0.97) and at least 30 months of prior {PI} exposure ({OR=0.64}, 0.41-0.99).
{CONCLUSIONS:} These results confirm that among heavily pretreated patients, prescription of efavirenz to {NNRTI-naive} patients is associated with a good virological response, while a high baseline viral load, a large number of {PI} mutations and nelfinavir prescription at baseline are associated with a poor virological response.

	abstract = {The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, including a combination of antivirals directed at various steps in the viral life cycle, has led to significant decreases in morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV-1)} infections. Despite the availability of numerous antivirals, many extensively treated patients gradually loose the ability to control viral replication because of development of antiviral resistance. Laboratory tests have been developed and validated to assist in recognizing such resistance and to help predict which antivirals may be more likely to control viral replication in a given patient. Both genotypic and phenotypic assays have been developed to assess {HIV-1} antiviral resistance. The assay methodologies, including the advantages and disadvantages of each method, as well as the limitations of each method are reviewed. The ability to predict likely drug response from a genotype or a phenotype is continually evolving, and the more recently discovered mutation/drug resistance associations are discussed in terms of their implications for {HIV} resistance assays. To provide additional options for those who have developed resistance to all currently available drugs, new antivirals, such as the fusion inhibitors, are being developed. These new classes of antivirals block the {HIV} viral life cycle at sites other than reverse transcriptase and protease. Unique and novel resistance assays are being developed to measure {HIV} resistance to these new drugs. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Med Res Rev, 24, No. 1, 115–125, 2004},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground} 
Growing evidence has linked {HIV-1} resistance mutations and drug failure. The use of genotypic-resistance analysis to assist therapeutic decision-making in patients failing therapy has not been investigated. We assessed the virological and immunological impact of genotypic-resistance testing. 
Methods 
We did a prospective, open, randomised, controlled study of {HIV-1-infected} patients in whom combination therapy was not successful. We randomly assigned patients standard care (control, n=43) or treatment according to the resistance mutations in protease and reverse-transcriptase genes (genotypic group, n=65). The major endpoint was the change in {HIV-1} {RNA} viral load. Analysis was by intention to treat. 
Findings 
108 patients were enrolled. All patients were similar for risk factors, age, sex, previous treatment, {CD4-cell} count ({214/fxL} [{SD14])} and log {HIV-1} {RNA} viral load at baseline (4–7 copies/ml [0–1]). At month 3, the mean change in {HIV-1} {RNA} was -1-04 log (0–14) in the study group compared with −0–46 log (0–17) in the control group (mean difference 0–58 log [95\% Cl 0-14-1-02], p=0–01). At month 6, changes were −1–15 (0–15) log {copies/mL}, and −0-67 (0–19) log {copies/mL} in the genotypic group and the control group, respectively (mean difference 0–48 log [0-01-0-97], p=0-05). Difference in the drop in viral load combined at 3 months and 6 months was significant (p=0-015). At month 3, {HIV-1} {RNA} was lower than detection level (200 {copies/mL)} in 29\% (19/65) of patients in the genotypic group versus 14\% (6/43) in the control group (p=0-017). At month 6, the values were 32\% (21/65) and 14\% (6/43) (p=0-067) for the genotypic group and the control group, respectively. Therapy was generally well tolerated, with ten patients (six in the genotypic group, four in the control group) requiring toxic-effect-related drug modification. 
Interpretation 
We found genotypic-resistance testing to have a significant benefit on the virological response when choosing a therapeutic alternative. Further study of the use of genotypic-resistance testing in assisting clinical decision-making is warranted.},

	abstract = {Background 
Several decision support systems have been developed to interpret {HIV-1} drug resistance genotyping results. This study compares the ability of the most commonly used systems ({ANRS}, Rega, and Stanford's {HIVdb)} to predict virological outcome at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. 
 
{Methodology/Principal} Findings 
Included were 3763 treatment-change episodes ({TCEs)} for which a {HIV-1} genotype was available at the time of changing treatment with at least one follow-up viral load measurement. Genotypic susceptibility scores for the active regimens were calculated using scores defined by each interpretation system. Using logistic regression, we determined the association between the genotypic susceptibility score and proportion of {TCEs} having an undetectable viral load ({\textless}50 copies/ml) at 12 (8–16) weeks (2152 {TCEs)}, 24 (16–32) weeks (2570 {TCEs)}, and 48 (44–52) weeks (1083 {TCEs).} The Area under the {ROC} curve was calculated using a 10-fold cross-validation to compare the different interpretation systems regarding the sensitivity and specificity for predicting undetectable viral load. The mean genotypic susceptibility score of the systems was slightly smaller for {HIVdb}, with 1.92±1.17, compared to Rega and {ANRS}, with 2.22±1.09 and 2.23±1.05, respectively. However, similar odds ratio's were found for the association between each-unit increase in genotypic susceptibility score and undetectable viral load at week 12; 1.6 [95\% confidence interval 1.5–1.7] for {HIVdb}, 1.7 [1.5–1.8] for {ANRS}, and 1.7 [1.9–1.6] for Rega. Odds ratio's increased over time, but remained comparable (odds ratio's ranging between 1.9–2.1 at 24 weeks and 1.9–2.2 at 48 weeks). The Area under the curve of the {ROC} did not differ between the systems at all time points; p = 0.60 at week 12, p = 0.71 at week 24, and p = 0.97 at week 48. 
 
{Conclusions/Significance} 
Three commonly used {HIV} drug resistance interpretation systems {ANRS}, Rega and {HIVdb} predict virological response at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, after change of treatment to the same extent.},

	abstract = {Witness for the prosecution: The dominating {HIV-1} subtype in Europe and in the {USA} is the B subtype, but the prevalence of circulating recombinant forms and non-B subtypes ({nBS)} in Europe has increased. {HIV-1} group O strains are spontaneously resistant to non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NNRTI)} and little is known about the antiretroviral ({ARV)} drug susceptibility of {nBS} clinical isolates. Controlled randomized trials showing a clinical benefit of a treatment guided by {HIV-1} resistance testing at virological failure have been conducted on subtype B. Thus, the result cannot be simply extended to {nBS.} In {nBS}, the frequency or amplification failure is increased, but retesting failed samples with an alternative set of polymerase chain reaction primers improves the success of amplification. The major problem is the reliability of genotypic resistance tests ({GRT)} owing to misinterpretation of the obtained amino acid mutations, the background sequence in {nBS} being different from the standard used in the commercial kits or in the web-based {HIV-1} resistance interpretation tools. At the moment, no {nBS} database is available to help in the interpretation of the protease and {RT} sequence results. Furthermore, the mutational pattern of specific {ARV} drugs may be different, in particular with subtype C and G. In conclusion, in patients with {nBS} the indication to for at virological failure may exists, even in the absence of clinical evidence, but the results have to be interpreted by experts with particular caution. Witness for the defence: The extensive variability of {HIV-1} has a potential impact on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy and the prevention of infection. Nine different major subtypes of group M (A-D, F-H, J and K) circulate to varying extents in populations around the globe together with the circulating recombinant forms ({CRF)} owing to intersubtype recombinations. Although viruses belonging to the {HIV-1} B clade are still predominant in Europe, the {USA} and Australia, an increasing prevalence of non-clade B subtypes and {CRF} has been reported by several surveys in previously homogeneous clade B countries. As current {ARV} have been designed using subtype B strains and resistance mutations have been characterized on this subtype, the increasing global spread of {HIV} subtypes highlights the need to determine the activity of anti-{HIV} drugs against subtypes or {CRF} other than subtype B.},

	abstract = {Within-patient {HIV} evolution reflects the strong selection pressure driving viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ({CTL)} recognition. Whether this intrapatient accumulation of escape mutations translates into {HIV} evolution at the population level has not been evaluated. We studied over 300 patients drawn from the B- and C-clade epidemics, focusing on human leukocyte antigen ({HLA)} alleles {HLA-B57} and {HLA-B5801}, which are associated with long-term {HIV} control and are therefore likely to exert strong selection pressure on the virus. The {CTL} response dominating acute infection in {HLA-B57/5801-positive} subjects drove positive selection of an escape mutation that reverted to wild-type after transmission to {HLA-B57/5801-negative} individuals. A second escape mutation within the epitope, by contrast, was maintained after transmission. These data show that the process of accumulation of escape mutations within {HIV} is not inevitable. Complex epitope- and residue-specific selection forces, including {CTL-mediated} positive selection pressure and virus-mediated purifying selection, operate in tandem to shape {HIV} evolution at the population level.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Guidelines recommend both protease inhibitor ({PI)-} and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ({NNRTI)-containing} regimens for initial therapy in {HIV-positive} individuals whilst clinical trial data comparing treatment options remain limited.
{OBJECTIVE:} To assess whether drug selection ({PI} versus {NNRTI)} in antiretroviral-naive patients is related to virological response at 6 months within a clinical cohort.
{DESIGN:} Databases from two large clinics were used to identify all treatment-naive patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy ({PI/} two {PI} or {NNRTI).} Statistical models determined the likelihood of suppressing {HIV} viral load {\textless} 500 copies/ml, the risk of treatment failure by 6 months, and factors associated with treatment success.
{RESULTS:} Of 1109 potentially eligible patients 888 met study criteria and were included; 484 were prescribed a {PI} (40\% indinavir, 41\% nelfinavir) and 404 were prescribed {NNRTI} (40\% efavirenz, 60\% nevirapine). Three treatment arms were compared: efavirenz versus nevirapine versus {PI.} After stratification by year and centre and adjustment for baseline variables, only treatment group and baseline viral load remained significantly associated with virological suppression at 6 months. Patients on efavirenz were significantly more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load than those on {PI} or nevirapine. The relative hazard for nevirapine was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.96, P = 0.02) and that for {PI} was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.58-0.94, P = 0.01). Efavirenz also performed better in the analysis of treatment failure at 6 months.
{CONCLUSION:} Although observational cohort data may be susceptible to significant bias, this study suggests a better initial virological response for efavirenz compared to either nevirapine or the {PI.} Clinical trial data is required to confirm these findings.},

Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic {DNA} or {RNA)} or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid {DNA} sequencing a possibility.

	abstract = {{DNA} sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of {DNA} are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30× average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {Next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies provide ultrahigh throughput at two orders of magnitude lower unit cost than capillary Sanger sequencing technology. One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and {SNP-detection} method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36× coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human {1M} {BeadChip} genotyped alleles from the same {DNA} sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of {dbSNP} alleles and were able to improve coverage of the {dbSNP} sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

Here we describe a {DNA} sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical {DNA} sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed {DNA} polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ({CMOS)} process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.},

In contrast to hybrid approaches, {HGAP} does not require highly accurate raw reads for error correction. We demonstrate efficient genome assembly for several microorganisms using as few as three {SMRT} Cell zero-mode waveguide arrays of sequencing and for {BACs} using just one {SMRT} Cell.

This population of beads then corresponds to a one-to-one representation of the starting {DNA} molecules. Variation within the original population of {DNA} molecules can then be simply assessed by counting fluorescently labeled particles via flow cytometry. This approach is called {BEAMing} on the basis of four of its principal components (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics). Millions of individual {DNA} molecules can be assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment. Moreover, specific variants can be isolated by flow sorting and used for further experimentation. {BEAMing} can be used for the identification and quantification of rare mutations as well as to study variations in gene sequences or transcripts in specific populations or tissues.},

The best results were obtained with 5′-thiol-modified oligonucleotides attached to amino-silanised glass slides using a heterobifunctional cross-linker reagent. It was then demonstrated that the primers bound to the glass surface using the optimal chemistry can be involved in attaching and amplifying {DNA} molecules present in the reaction mix in the absence of freely-diffusing primers. Two distinct amplification processes called interfacial and surface amplification have been observed and characterised. The newly synthesised {DNA} can be detected and quantified by radioactive and fluorescent hybridisation assays. These new surface amplification processes are seen as an interesting approach for attachment of {DNA} molecules by their 5′-end on a solid support and can be used as an alternative route for producing {DNA} chips for genomic studies.},

We have characterized the derivatized surfaces for the chemical attachment of oligonucleotides and evaluate the properties relevant for the amplification process: surface density, thermal stability towards thermocycling, functionalization reproducibility and storage stability. The derivatization process, first developed for glass slides, was then adapted to microfabricated glass channels containing integrated fluidic connections. This implementation resulted in an important reduction of reaction times, consumption of reagents and process automation. Innovative analytical methods for the characterization of attached {DNA} were developed for assessing the surface immobilized {DNA} content after amplification. The results obtained showed that the {BTA} chemistry is compatible and suitable for forming highly dense arrays of {DNA} colonies with optimal surface coverage of about 10 million colonies/cm2 from the amplification of initial single-template {DNA} molecules immobilized. We also demonstrate that the {dsDNA} colonies generated can be quantitatively processed in situ by restriction enzymes digestion. {DNA} colonies generated using the {BTA} reagent can be used for further sequence analysis in an unprecedented parallel fashion for low-cost genomic studies.},

	abstract = {Results from physical mapping projects have recently been reported for the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans, and similar projects are currently being planned for other organisms. In such projects, the physical map is assembled by first “fingerprinting” a large number of clones chosen at random from a recombinant library and then inferring overlaps between clones with sufficiently similar fingerprints. Although the basic approach is the same, there are many possible choices for the fingerprint used to characterize the clones and the rules for declaring overlap. In this paper, we derive simple formulas showing how the progress of a physical mapping project is affected by the nature of the fingerprinting scheme. Using these formulas, we discuss the analytic considerations involved in selecting an appropriate fingerprinting scheme for a particular project.},

	abstract = {A complete physical map of the {DNA} of an organism, consisting of overlapping clones spanning the genome, is an extremely useful tool for genomic analysis. Various methods for the construction of such physical maps are available. One approach is to assemble the physical map by “fingerprinting” a large number of random clones and inferring overlap between clones with sufficiently similar fingerprints. E. S. Lander and M. S. Waterman (1988, Genomics 2:231–239) have recently provided a mathematical analysis of such physical mapping schemes, useful for planning such a project. Another approach is to assemble the physical map by “anchoring” a large number of random clones—that is, by taking random short regions called anchors and identifying the clones containing each anchor. Here, we provide a mathematical analysis of such a physical mapping scheme.},

These analyses provide a global view of the chromatin architecture of a multicellular animal at extremely high density and resolution. While we observe some degree of reproducible positioning throughout the genome in our mixed stage population of animals, we note that the major chromatin feature in the worm is a diversity of allowed nucleosome positions at the vast majority of individual loci. While absolute positioning of nucleosomes can vary substantially, relative positioning of nucleosomes (in a repeated array structure likely to be maintained at least in part by steric constraints) appears to be a significant property of chromatin structure. The high density of nucleosomal reads enabled a substantial extension of previous analysis describing the usage of individual oligonucleotide sequences along the span of the nucleosome core and linker. We release this data set, via the {UCSC} Genome Browser, as a resource for the high-resolution analysis of chromatin conformation and {DNA} accessibility at individual loci within the C. elegans genome.},

	abstract = {Background 
Whole-genome sequencing represents a promising approach to pinpoint chemically induced mutations in genetic model organisms, thereby short-cutting time-consuming genetic mapping efforts. 
 
Principal Findings 
We compare here the ability of two leading high-throughput platforms for paired-end deep sequencing, {SOLiD} ({ABI)} and Genome Analyzer (Illumina; {“Solexa”)}, to achieve the goal of mutant detection. As a test case we used a mutant C. elegans strain that harbors a mutation in the lsy-12 locus which we compare to the reference wild-type genome sequence. We analyzed the accuracy, sensitivity, and depth-coverage characteristics of the two platforms. Both platforms were able to identify the mutation that causes the phenotype of the mutant C. elegans strain, lsy-12. Based on a 4 {MB} genomic region in which individual variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, we observe tradeoffs between rates of false positives and false negatives when using both platforms under similar coverage and mapping criteria. 
 
Significance 
In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing conducted by either platform is a viable approach for the identification of single-nucleotide variations in the C. elegans genome.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an approach to developing {MOSFET-based} scalable sensor arrays in an unmodified standard {CMOS} process. The multiplexed design can be used as either a single-ended or differential circuit to make potentiometric measurements in each cell of the array. The {FET-based} sensors employ a floating gate electrode structure and use the nitride passivation layer as a {pH-sensitive} membrane. An implementation of a single-chip 2×2 array fabricated in an unmodified commercial 0.35 μm {CMOS} process is presented. All signal acquisition is performed in-situ and all readout circuitry is located on-chip. On return from the foundry, the devices are exposed to ultraviolet light to eliminate any difference in threshold voltage. The circuit provides a sufficient linear range that allows the {FET} devices to operate as {pH} sensors in the array. A double layer of {SU-8} photoresist is used to provide both a biocompatible and waterproof package for the chip. The biocompatibility of the chip surface is investigated using a well-established cell line.},

An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the {DNA}, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8\%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard {DNA} bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.},

The simplest form of nanopore {DNA} sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that individual nucleotides of single-stranded {DNA} passing through a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield the {DNA} sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, {MspA}, has the ability to distinguish all four {DNA} nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded {DNA} when double-stranded {DNA} temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing {DNA} with a series of double-stranded sections through {MspA} provides proof of principle of a simple {DNA} sequencing method using a nanopore.

The films contain macroscopic nonconducting holes, and we introduce the holes in the simulation formalism by reconstruction of the magnetic field change inside the holes. We find that the holes induce a region of reduced flux density extending toward the nearest sample edge, in addition to the parabolic d lines. The region of reduced flux density is due to compression of current streamlines and is accompanied by a significantly enhanced flux traffic. The results are compared to and found to be in good agreement with experimental magneto-optical images of {YBa2Cu3Ox} films including holes and slits.},

	abstract = {Among the variety of roles for nanopores in biology, an important one is enabling polymer transport, for example in gene transfer between bacteria and transport of {RNA} through the nuclear membrane. Recently, this has inspired the use of protein and solid-state nanopores as single-molecule sensors for the detection and structural analysis of {DNA} and {RNA} by voltage-driven translocation. The magnitude of the force involved is of fundamental importance in understanding and exploiting this translocation mechanism, yet so far it has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate the first measurements of the force on a single {DNA} molecule in a solid-state nanopore by combining optical tweezers with ionic-current detection. The opposing force exerted by the optical tweezers can be used to slow down and even arrest the translocation of the {DNA} molecules. We obtain a value of 0.240.02 {pN} {mV-1} for the force on a single {DNA} molecule, independent of salt concentration from 0.02 to 1 M {KCl.} This force corresponds to an effective charge of 0.500.05 electrons per base pair equivalent to a 75\% reduction of the bare {DNA} charge.},

	abstract = {Nanopores have been explored as highly sensitive sensors for detection and rapid sequencing of single molecules of {DNA.} To sequence {DNA} with a nanopore requires that adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G) produce distinct current signals as they traverse the pore. Recently, we demonstrated that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, and thymine immobilized in the nanopore protein α-hemolysin ({αHL)} produced distinct current blockades dependent on their chemical orientation. To probe the detection limit of {αHL}, we examined immobilized single strands of T40 {DNA} ({polyT)} with single base substitutions of A, C, and G at 12 positions on the strand occupying the stem region of {αHL.} We find blockade currents sensitive to base identity over most of these positions with the most sensitive region near the pore constriction. Adenine substitutions increase the measured blockade current to values intermediate to the {polyT} and {polyA} currents at a number of positions, while C substitutions increase the current to a level intermediate to {polyT} and {polyC} values in some positions, but decrease it below {polyT} in others. These changes in blockade current were also observed for G substitutions. These results indicate that total blockade currents measured in {αHL} arise from nucleotides at multiple locations and thus are not uniquely attributable to an individual base in a specific position, a finding consistent with a recently published study. The measurements of C and G substitutions also suggest that blockade current may be modulated through interactions between nucleotides and the pore interior at multiple sites in {αHL.}},

Further, {MspA} has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for {DNA} sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a {ssDNA} molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an {MspA} mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of {ssDNA} as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of ≈20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed {ssDNA} to reside in the vestibule ≈100 times longer than the first mutant.

{APOBEC3G} is a human cellular enzyme that is incorporated into retroviral particles and acts to restrict retroviral replication in infected cells by deaminating {dC} to {dU} in the first (minus)-strand {cDNA} replication intermediate [1–5]. {HIV}, however, encodes a protein (virion infectivity factor, Vif [6, 7]), which overcomes {APOBEC3G-mediated} restriction but by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Vif triggers {APOBEC3G} degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway and that an 80 amino acid region of {APOBEC3G} surrounding its first zinc coordination motif is sufficient to confer the ability to partake in an interaction involving Vif. Inhibitors of this interaction might therefore prove therapeutically useful in blocking Vif-mediated {APOBEC3G} destruction.},

	abstract = {Summary 
The use of anti-{HIV} drugs as cancer treatments is not new. Azidothymidine was studied as an antineoplastic in the 1990s, but despite promising in vitro data, clinical trials showed little antitumour activity. {HIV} protease inhibitors were developed in the early 1990s, and their subsequent incorporation into highly active antiretroviral therapy ({HAART)} has profoundly changed the natural history of {HIV} infection. The potential antitumour properties of these drugs have been investigated because of their success in treating {HIV-related} Kaposi's sarcoma. {HAART's} effects on Kaposi's sarcoma did not always correlate with immune reconstitution, and activity against other solid and haematological malignancies has been established. Inhibition of tumour-cell invasion and angiogenesis were properties first ascribed to inhibition of {HIV} protease; however, they have pleiotropic antitumour effects, including inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, proteasome activity, cell proliferation and survival, and induction of apoptosis. {HIV} protease inhibitors are thus a new class of anticancer drugs with multiple effects, and other anti-{HIV} drugs might hold similar promise.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} integrase ({IN)} is one of three essential enzymes (along with reverse transcriptase and protease) encoded by the viral pol gene. {IN} mediates two critical reactions during viral replication; firstly 3′-end processing ({3′EP)} of the double-stranded viral {DNA} ends and then strand transfer ({STF)} which joins the viral {DNA} to the host chromosomal {DNA} forming a functional integrated proviral {DNA.} {IN} is a 288 amino acid protein containing three functional domains, the N-terminal domain ({NTD)}, catalytic core domain ({CCD)} and the C-terminal domain ({CTD).} The {CCD} contains three conserved catalytic residues, Asp64, Asp116 and Glu152, which coordinate divalent metal ions essential for the {STF} reaction. Intensive research over the last two decades has led to the discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors of the {IN} {STF} reaction ({INSTIs).} {INSTIs} are catalytic inhibitors of {IN}, and act to chelate the divalent metal ions in the {CCD.} One {INSTI}, raltegravir ({RAL}, Merck Inc.) was approved in late 2007 for the treatment of {HIV-1} infection in patients with prior antiretroviral ({ARV)} treatment experience and was recently approved also for first line therapy. A second {INSTI}, elvitegravir ({EVG}, Gilead Sciences, Inc.) is currently undergoing phase 3 studies in {ARV} treatment-experienced patients and phase 2 studies in {ARV} naïve patients as part of a novel fixed dose combination. Several additional {INSTIs} are in early stage clinical development. This review will discuss the discovery and development of this novel class of antiretrovirals.

The differences in the variant calls were investigated with regards to coverage, and sequencing error. Some of the variants called by only one or two of the platforms were experimentally tested using mass spectrometry; a method that is independent of {DNA} sequencing. We establish several causes why variants remained unreported, specific to each platform. We report the indel called using the three sequencing technologies and from the obtained results we conclude that sequencing human genomes with more than a single platform and multiple libraries is beneficial when high level of accuracy is required.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies enable the rapid cost-effective production of sequence data. To evaluate the performance of these sequencing technologies, investigation of the quality of sequence reads obtained from these methods is important. In this study, we analyzed the quality of sequence reads and {SNP} detection performance using three commercially available next-generation sequencers, i.e., Roche Genome Sequencer {FLX} System ({FLX)}, Illumina Genome Analyzer ({GA)}, and Applied Biosystems {SOLiD} system ({SOLiD).} A common genomic {DNA} sample obtained from Escherichia coli strain {DH1} was applied to these sequencers. The obtained sequence reads were aligned to the complete genome sequence of E. coli {DH1}, to evaluate the accuracy and sequence bias of these sequence methods. We found that the fraction of “junk” data, which could not be aligned to the reference genome, was largest in the data set of {SOLiD}, in which about half of reads could not be aligned. Among data sets after alignment to the reference, sequence accuracy was poorest in {GA} data sets, suggesting relatively low fidelity of the elongation reaction in the {GA} method. Furthermore, by aligning the sequence reads to the E. coli strain W3110, we screened sequence differences between two E. coli strains using data sets of three different next-generation platforms. The results revealed that the detected sequence differences were similar among these three methods, while the sequence coverage required for the detection was significantly small in the {FLX} data set. These results provided valuable information on the quality of short sequence reads and the performance of {SNP} detection in three next-generation sequencing platforms.},

This dramatic price decline will herald widespread personal genome sequencing and lead to significant improvements in human health and reduced health care costs. Key to realizing these benefits will be medical genomics' and systems biology's success in providing increasing contextual interpretation of biological and medical effects of the detected sequence variants in a genome. Given the substantial potential benefits and the manageability of the health and discrimination risks involved with the possible misuse of this information, we propose that governments and insurance companies support or even require personal genome sequencing.

The T-cell tropism of {HTLV} and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as {AIDS.} Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor ({TCGF)} an shown to express {HTLV} antigens. Virus from the {U.S.} patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to {HTLV} subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not {HTLV-I} or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause {AIDS}, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others. If the target cell of {AIDS} is the mature T cell as suspected, the methods used in these studies may prove useful for the long-term growth of these cells and for the identification of antigens specific for the etiological agent of {AIDS.}},

	abstract = {The main (M) group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} is responsible for the global {AIDS} epidemic while {HIV-1} group O (outlier) and {HIV} type 2 are endemic only in west and central Africa. The failure of {HIV-2} and especially {HIV-1} group O to spread following the initial zoonotic jumps is not well understood. This study was designed to examine the relative replicative capacities between these human lentiviruses. A pairwise competition experiment was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells with eight {HIV-2} isolates, 6 group O viruses, and 15 group M viruses of subtype A (2 viruses), B (5 viruses), C (4 viruses), D (2 viruses) and {CRF01\_AE} (2 viruses). {HIV-1} group M isolates of any subtype were typically 100-fold-more fit than group O or {HIV-2} strains when competed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from various humans. This order in replicative fitness was also observed when virus pairs were added to human dendritic cells and then cocultured with primary, quiescent T cells, which is the model for {HIV-1} transmission. These results suggest that reduced replicative and transmission fitness may be contributing to the low prevalence and limited geographical spread of {HIV-2} and group O {HIV-1} in the human population.},

The absence of vpu resulted in an accumulation of cell-associated viral proteins and impaired the release of progeny virions. Both electron microscopic and biochemical analyses indicated that a large proportion of the mutant particles was attached to the surface of infected cells. Significant variation in the size and shape of these progeny virions was observed. In addition, intracytoplasmic particles, some of which formed aberrant budding structures, were visualized in T cells infected with the vpu mutant. Indirect immunofluorescence analyses of cultures inoculated with wild-type virus with use of a vpu-specific antiserum demonstrated that vpu is mainly localized to a perinuclear region in the cytoplasm of virus-producing cells.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} group O originated through cross-species transmission of {SIV} from chimpanzees to humans and has established a relatively low prevalence in Central Africa. Here, we infer the population genetics and epidemic history of {HIV-1} group O from viral gene sequence data and evaluate the effect of variable evolutionary rates and recombination on our estimates. First, model selection tools were used to specify suitable evolutionary and coalescent models for {HIV} group O. Second, divergence times and population genetic parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, under both strict and relaxed molecular clock methods. Our results date the origin of the group O radiation to around 1920 (1890–1940), a time frame similar to that estimated for {HIV-1} group M. However, group O infections, which remain almost wholly restricted to Cameroon, show a slower rate of exponential growth during the twentieth century, explaining their lower current prevalence. To explore the effect of recombination, the Bayesian framework is extended to incorporate multiple unlinked loci. Although recombination can bias estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor, this effect does not appear to be important for {HIV-1} group O. In addition, we show that evolutionary rate estimates for different {HIV} genes accurately reflect differential selective constraints along the {HIV} genome.},

Several studies have suggested that the membrane-binding signal is contained within the amino-terminal matrix sequence; however, the precise location has never been determined for the Gag protein of any retrovirus. In this report, we show that the first 31 residues of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag protein can function independently as a membrane-targeting domain when fused to heterologous proteins. A bipartite membrane-targeting motif was identified, consisting of the myristylated N-terminal 14 amino acids and a highly basic region that binds acidic phospholipids. Replacement of the N-terminal membrane-targeting domain of pp60v-src with that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag elicits efficient membrane binding and a transforming phenotype. Removal of myristate or the basic region results in decreased membrane binding of Gag-Src chimeras in vitro and impaired virion formation by Pr55gag in vivo. We propose that the N-terminal Gag sequence functions as a targeting signal to direct interaction with acidic phospholipids on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane.},

Here, we utilize biochemical fractionation techniques as well as high-resolution confocal imaging of live cells to demonstrate that Gag is localized at the plasma membrane in a striking punctate pattern. Mutation of the N-terminal myristoylation site results in the formation of large cytosolic complexes, whereas mutation of the N-terminal basic residue cluster in the matrix domain redirects the Gag protein to a region partially overlapping the Golgi apparatus.

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} particle formation and the subsequent initiation of protease-mediated maturation occur predominantly on the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which {HIV-1} assembly is targeted specifically to the plasma membrane versus intracellular membranes is largely unknown. Previously, we observed that mutations between residues 84 and 88 of the matrix ({MA)} domain of {HIV-1} Gag cause a retargeting of virus particle formation to an intracellular site. In this study, we demonstrate that the mutant virus assembly occurs in the Golgi or in post-Golgi vesicles. These particles undergo core condensation in a protease-dependent manner, indicating that virus maturation can occur not only on the plasma membrane but also in the Golgi or post-Golgi vesicles. The intracellular assembly of mutant particles is dependent on Gag myristylation but is not influenced by {p6Gag} or envelope glycoprotein expression. Previous characterization of viral revertants suggested a functional relationship between the highly basic domain of {MA} (amino acids 17 to 31) and residues 84 to 88. We now demonstrate that mutations in the highly basic domain also retarget virus particle formation to the Golgi or post-Golgi vesicles. Although the basic domain has been implicated in Gag membrane binding, no correlation was observed between the impact of mutations on membrane binding and Gag targeting, indicating that these two functions of {MA} are genetically separable. Plasma membrane targeting of Gag proteins with mutations in either the basic domain or between residues 84 and 88 was rescued by coexpression with wild-type Gag; however, the two groups of {MA} mutants could not rescue each other. We propose that the highly basic domain of {MA} contains a major determinant of {HIV-1} Gag plasma membrane targeting and that mutations between residues 84 and 88 disrupt plasma membrane targeting through an effect on the basic domain.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} assembly-and-release pathway begins with the targeting of the Gag precursor to the site of virus assembly. The molecular mechanism by which Gag is targeted to the appropriate subcellular location remains poorly understood. Based on the analysis of mutant Gag proteins, we and others have previously demonstrated that a highly basic patch in the matrix ({MA)} domain of Gag is a major determinant of Gag transport to the plasma membrane. In this study, we determined that in {HeLa} and T cells, the {MA} mutant Gag proteins that are defective in plasma membrane targeting form virus particles in a {CD63-positive} compartment, defined as the late endosome or multivesicular body ({MVB).} Interestingly, we find that in primary human macrophages, both wild-type ({WT)} and {MA} mutant Gag proteins are targeted specifically to the {MVB.} Despite the fact that particle assembly in macrophages occurs at an intracellular site rather than at the plasma membrane, we observe that {WT} Gag expressed in this cell type is released as extracellular virions with high efficiency. These results demonstrate that Gag targeting to and assembly in the {MVB} are physiologically important steps in {HIV-1} virus particle production in macrophages and that particle release in this cell type may follow an exosomal pathway. To determine whether Gag targeting to the {MVB} is the result of an interaction between the late domain in {p6Gag} and the {MVB} sorting machinery (e.g., {TSG101)}, we examined the targeting and assembly of Gag mutants lacking p6. Significantly, the {MVB} localization of Gag was still observed in the absence of p6, suggesting that an interaction between Gag and {TSG101} is not required for Gag targeting to the {MVB.} These data are consistent with a model for Gag targeting that postulates two different cellular binding partners for Gag, one on the plasma membrane and the other in the {MVB.}},

However, the mechanism by which {NC} facilitates the assembly process is not clearly established. Formally, {NC} could act by constraining the Pr55gag polyprotein into an assembly-competent conformation or by masking residues which block the assembly process. Alternatively, the capacity of {NC} to bind {RNA} or make interprotein contacts might affect particle assembly. To examine its role in the assembly process, we replaced the {NC} domain in Pr55gag with polypeptide domains of known function, and the chimeric proteins were analyzed for their abilities to direct the release of virus-like particles. Our results indicate that {NC} does not mask inhibitory domains and does not act passively, by simply providing a stable folded monomeric structure. However, replacement of {NC} by polypeptides which form interprotein contacts permitted efficient virus particle assembly and release, even when {RNA} was not detected in the particles. These results suggest that formation of interprotein contacts by {NC} is essential to the normal {HIV-1} assembly process.},

Consistent with previous investigations, a truncation containing only the matrix and capsid regions of Gag was unable to assemble efficiently into particles; also, the pelletable material released was lighter than the density of wild-type {HIV-1.} A deletion mutant lacking p7 nucleocapsid but containing the C-terminal p6 protein was also inefficient in particle release and released lighter particles, while a truncation containing only the first zinc finger of p7 could assemble more efficiently into virions. These results clearly show that p7 is indispensable for virus assembly and release. Some point mutations in the N-terminal basic domain and in the basic linker region between the two zinc fingers, which had been previously shown to have reduced {RNA} bindingin vitro[Schmalzbauer, E., Strack, B., Dannull, J., Guehmann, S., and Moelling, K.

A fusion protein consisting of matrix and capsid fused to a heterologous viral protein known to have nonspecific {RNA} binding activity [Ribas, J. C., Fujimura, T., and Wickner, R. B. ({1994)J.} Biol. Chem.269: 28420–28428] released pelletable material slightly more efficiently than matrix and capsid alone, and these particles had density higher than matrix and capsid alone.

The mature capsids of {HIV} and other retroviruses organize and package the viral genome and its associated enzymes for delivery into host cells. The {HIV} capsid is a fullerene cone: a variably curved, closed shell composed of approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the viral {CA} protein. We devised methods for isolating soluble, assembly-competent {CA} hexamers and derived four crystallographically independent models that define the structure of this capsid assembly unit at atomic resolution. A ring of six {CA} N-terminal domains form an apparently rigid core, surrounded by an outer ring of C-terminal domains. Mobility of the outer ring appears to be an underlying mechanism for generating the variably curved lattice in authentic capsids. Hexamer-stabilizing interfaces are highly hydrated, and this property may be key to the formation of quasi-equivalent interactions within hexamers and pentamers. The structures also clarify the molecular basis for capsid assembly inhibition and should facilitate structure-based drug design strategies.},

The protein folds into a five-stranded mixed beta sheet flanked by an asymmetric distribution of four alpha helices. Two divalent metal cations bind in the active site surrounded by a cluster of four conserved acidic amino acid residues. The overall structure is similar in most respects to the {RNase} H from Escherichia coli. Structural features characteristic of the retroviral protein suggest how it may interface with the {DNA} polymerase domain of p66 in the mature {RT} heterodimer. These features also offer insights into why the isolated {RNase} H domain is catalytically inactive but when combined in vitro with the isolated p51 domain of {RT} {RNase} H activity can be reconstituted. Surprisingly, the peptide bond cleaved by {HIV-1} protease near the polymerase-{RNase} H junction of p66 is completely inaccessible to solvent in the structure reported here. This suggests that the homodimeric p66-p66 precursor of mature {RT} is asymmetric with one of the two {RNase} H domains at least partially unfolded.},

Importantly, for {DNA} with all of these properties, the distortion of the double helix directed by association with the histone proteins promotes the integration reaction and alters the distribution of sites that are selected for integration.

Previous studies identified an α-helical domain within gp41 composed of a trimer of two interacting peptides. The crystal structure of this complex, composed of the peptides N36 and C34, is a six-helical bundle. Three N36 helices form an interior, parallel coiled-coil trimer, while three C34 helices pack in an oblique, antiparallel manner into highly conserved, hydrophobic grooves on the surface of this trimer. This structure shows striking similarity to the low-{pH-induced} conformation of influenza hemagglutinin and likely represents the core of fusion-active gp41.

However, immunization with recombinant gp120 does not elicit neutralizing antibodies against multiple {HIV-1} isolates (broadly neutralizing antibodies), and gp120 failed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy in recent clinical trials. Ongoing crystallographic studies of gp120 molecules from {HIV-1} and {SIV} increasingly reveal how conserved regions, which are the targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies, are concealed from immune recognition. Based on this structural insight and that from studies of antibody structures, a number of strategies are being pursued to design immunogens that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to gp120. These include (a) the construction of mimics of the viral envelope spike and (b) the design of antigens specifically tailored to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein (gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo-electron tomography combined with three-dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three-dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native {HIV-1} in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with {CD4} and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and {CD4/17b-bound} conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native {HIV-1} gp120 trimer in unliganded and {CD4-bound} states. We demonstrate that {CD4} binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes. Our findings elucidate the structure and conformational changes of trimeric {HIV-1} gp120 relevant to antibody neutralization and attachment to target cells.},

The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding,. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, {CD4} and a neutralizing antibody. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions.

Three-dimensional averaging showed that the surface glycoprotein (gp120) 'head' of each subunit of the trimeric {SIV} spike contains a primary mass, with two secondary lobes. The transmembrane glycoprotein 'stalk' of each trimer is composed of three independent legs that project obliquely from the trimer head, tripod-like.

	abstract = {Infection by {HIV-1} involves the fusion of viral and cellular membranes with subsequent transfer of viral genetic material into the cell. The {HIV-1} envelope glycoprotein that mediates fusion consists of the surface subunit gp120 and the transmembrane subunit gp41. gp120 directs virion attachment to the cell–surface receptors, and gp41 then promotes viral–cell membrane fusion. A soluble, α-helical, trimeric complex within gp41 composed of N-terminal and C-terminal extraviral segments has been proposed to represent the core of the fusion-active conformation of the {HIV-1} envelope. A thermostable subdomain denoted N34({L6)C28} can be formed by the N-34 and C-28 peptides connected by a flexible linker in place of the disulfide-bonded loop region. Three-dimensional structure of N34({L6)C28} reveals that three molecules fold into a six-stranded helical bundle. Three N-terminal helices within the bundle form a central, parallel, trimeric coiled coil, whereas three C-terminal helices pack in the reverse direction into three hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the N-terminal trimer. This thermostable subdomain displays the salient features of the core structure of the isolated gp41 subunit and thus provides a possible target for therapeutics designed selectively to block {HIV-1} entry.},

{HIV-1} employs its envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) composed of gp120 and gp41 to catalyze cell entry. Both Env subunits undergo conformational changes triggered by the gp120-mediated interactions with cellular receptors. Notably, gp41 refolds into a core six-helical bundle structure which is central to the fusion process. Here we report the structural basis for the folding of the linker regions connecting to the membrane anchors of gp41, namely to the transmembrane region ({MPER)} and to the fusion peptide ({FPPR).} Our structural analysis shows helical assemblies of {FPPR} and {MPER} which increase the melting temperature of gp41 and position the fusion peptide towards the outside of the six-helix bundle structure at this stage of gp41 refolding. It suggests that part of {MPER} must be inserted into the viral membrane, which would induce membrane curvature as postulated to be required for the fusion reaction. Thus our findings shed new light on the refolding of gp41, which contributes energy to the fusion reaction and reveals for the first time the structural principles of {MPER} membrane interaction within trimeric gp41. We propose that the structure presents a late fusion intermediate state that provides a new framework for fusion inhibitor development and {MPER} immunogen design.},

	abstract = {T20 (Fuzeon), a novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} drug, is a peptide derived from {HIV-1} gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat ({CHR).} Its mechanism of action has not yet been defined. We applied Pepscan strategy to determine the relationship between functional domains and mechanisms of action of five 36-mer overlapping peptides with a shift of five amino acids (aa): {CHR-1} (aa 623–658), C36 (aa 628–663), {CHR-3} (aa 633–668), T20 (aa 638–673), and {CHR-5} (aa 643–678). C36 is a peptide with addition of two aa to the N terminus of C34. Peptides {CHR-1} and C36 contain N-terminal heptad repeat ({NHR)-} and pocket-binding domains. They inhibited {HIV-1} fusion by interacting with gp41 {NHR}, forming stable six-helix bundles and blocking gp41 core formation. Peptide T20 containing partial {NHR-} and lipid-binding domains, but lacking pocket-binding domain, blocked viral fusion by binding its N- and C-terminal sequences with gp41 {NHR} and cell membrane, respectively. Peptide {CHR-3}, which is located in the middle between C36 and T20, overlaps {\textgreater}86\% of the sequences of these two peptides, and lacks pocket- and lipid-binding domains, exhibited marginal anti-{HIV-1} activity. These results suggest that T20 and C36 contain different functional domains, through which they inhibit {HIV-1} entry with distinct mechanisms of action. The multiple functional domains in gp41 {CHR} and their binding partners may serve as targets for rational design of new anti-{HIV-1} drugs and vaccines.},

A prominent pocket on the surface of a central trimeric coiled coil within gp41 was previously identified as a potential target for drugs that inhibit {HIV-1} entry. We designed a peptide, {IQN17}, which properly presents this pocket. Utilizing {IQN17} and mirror-image phage display, we identified cyclic, D-peptide inhibitors of {HIV-1} infection that share a sequence motif. A 1.5 Å cocrystal structure of {IQN17} in complex with a D-peptide, and {NMR} studies, show that conserved residues of these inhibitors make intimate contact with the gp41 pocket. Our studies validate the pocket per se as a target for drug development. {IQN17} and these D-peptide inhibitors are likely to be useful for development and identification of a new class of orally bioavailable anti-{HIV} drugs.},

	abstract = {Many viral fusion proteins exhibit a six-helix bundle as a core structure. {HIV} Env–induced fusion was studied to resolve whether membrane merger was due to the transition into the bundle configuration or occurred after bundle formation. Suboptimal temperature was used to arrest fusion at an intermediate stage. When bundle formation was prevented by adding inhibitory peptides at this stage, membranes did not merge upon raising temperature. Inversely, when membrane merger was prevented by incorporating lysophosphatidylcholine ({LPC)} into cell membranes at the intermediate, the bundle did not form upon optimizing temperature. In the absence of {LPC}, the six-helix bundle did not form when the temperature of the intermediate was raised for times too short to promote fusion. Kinetic measures showed that after the temperature pulse, cells had not advanced further toward fusion. The latter results indicate that bundle formation is the rate-limiting step between the arrested intermediate and fusion. Electrical measures showed that the {HIV} Env–induced pore is initially large and grows rapidly. It is proposed that bundle formation and fusion are each contingent on the other and that movement of Env during its transition into the six-helix bundle directly induces the lipid rearrangements of membrane fusion. Because peptide inhibition showed that, at the intermediate stage, the heptad repeats of gp41 have become stably exposed, creation of the intermediate could be of importance in drug and/or vaccine development.},

	abstract = {The fusogenic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} gp41 core structure is a stable six-helix bundle formed by its N- and C-terminal heptad repeat sequences. Notably, the negatively charged residue Asp632 located at the pocket-binding motif in the C-terminal heptad repeat interacts with the positively charged residue Lys574 in the pocket formation region of the N-terminal heptad repeat to form a salt bridge. We previously demonstrated that the residue Lys574 plays an essential role in six-helix bundle formation and virus infectivity and is a key determinant of the target for anti-{HIV} fusion inhibitors. In this study, the functionality of residue Asp632 has been specifically characterized by mutational analysis and biophysical approaches. We show that Asp632 substitutions with positively charged residues ({D632K} and {D632R)} or a hydrophobic residue ({D632V)} could completely abolish Env-mediated viral entry, while a protein with a conserved substitution ({D632E)} retained its activity. Similar to the Lys574 mutations, nonconserved substitutions of Asp632 also severely impaired the α-helicity, stability, and conformation of six-helix bundles as shown by N36 and C34 peptides as a model system. Furthermore, nonconserved substitutions of Asp632 significantly reduced the potency of C34 to sequestrate six-helix bundle formation and to inhibit {HIV-1-mediated} cell-cell fusion and infection, suggesting its importance for designing antiviral fusion inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that the salt bridge between the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions of the fusion-active {HIV-1} gp41 core structure is critical for viral entry and inhibition.},

We find that although the {PICs} are large, the {cDNA} must be condensed to fit into the measured volume. The ends of the {cDNA} are probably linked by a protein bridge, since coordinated joining of the two ends is not disrupted by cleaving the {cDNA} internally with a restriction enzyme. {cDNA} ends in {PICs} were protected from digestion by added exonucleases, probably due to binding of proteins. The intervening {cDNA}, in contrast, was susceptible to attack by endonucleases. Previous work has established that the virus-encoded integrase protein is present in {PICs}, and we have reported recently that the host protein {HMG} I(Y) is also present. Here we report that the viral matrix and reverse transcriptase ({RT)} proteins also cofractionated with {PICs} through several steps whereas capsid and nucleocapsid proteins dissociated. These data support a model of {PIC} organization in which the {cDNA} is condensed in a partially disassembled remnant of the viral core, with proteins tightly associated at the apposed {cDNA} ends but loosely associated with the intervening {cDNA.} In characterizing the structure of the {cDNA} ends, we found that the U5 {DNA} ends created by {RT} were ragged, probably due to the terminal transferase activity of {RT.} Only molecules correctly cleaved by integrase protein at the 3' ends were competent to integrate, suggesting that one role for terminal cleavage by integrase may be to create a defined end at otherwise heterogeneous {cDNA} termini.},

Genetic evidence suggests that viral protein R (Vpr) and matrix antigen ({MA)} are directly involved in the import process. An in vitro assay that reconstitutes nuclear import of {HIV-1} pre-integration complexes in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to demonstrate that Vpr is the key regulator of the viral nuclear import process. Mutant {HIV-1} pre-integration complexes that lack Vpr failed to be imported in vitro, whereas mutants that lack a functional {MA} nuclear localization sequence ({NLS)} were only partially defective. Strikingly, the import defect of the Vpr- mutant was rescued when recombinant Vpr was re-added. In addition, import of Vpr- virus was rescued by adding the cytosol of {HeLa} cells, where {HIV-1} replication had been shown to be Vpr-independent. In a solution binding assay, Vpr associated with karyopherin , a cellular receptor for {NLSs.} This association increased the affinity of karyopherin for basic-type {NLSs}, including that of {MA}, thus explaining the positive effect of Vpr on nuclear import of the {HIV-1} pre-integration complex and {BSA–NLS} conjugates. These results identify the biochemical mechanism of Vpr function in transport of the viral pre-integration complex to, and across, the nuclear membrane.},

Functional {HIV-1} integrase, an essential component of the preintegration complex, was not required for nuclear import of these complexes. The ability of {HIV-1} to use host cell active transport processes for nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex obviates the requirement for host cell division in establishment of the integrated provirus. These findings are pertinent to our understanding of early events in the life cycle of {HIV-1} and to the mode of {HIV-1} replication in terminally differentiated nondividing cells such as macrophages (monocytes, tissue macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and microglial cells).},

	abstract = {Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)} in non-dividing cells depends critically on import of the viral preintegration complex into the nucleus. Recent evidence suggests that viral protein R (Vpr) plays a key regulatory role in this process by binding to karyopherin α, a cellular receptor for nuclear localization signals, and increasing its affinity for the nuclear localization signals. An in vitro binding assay was used to investigate the role of Vpr in docking of the {HIV-1} preintegration complex ({PIC)} to the nuclear pore complex. Mutant {HIV-1} {PICs} that lack Vpr were impaired in the ability to dock to isolated nuclei and recombinant nucleoporins. Although Vpr by itself associated with nucleoporins, the docking of Vpr+ {PICs} was dependent on karyopherin β and was blocked by antibodies to β. Vpr stabilized docking by preventing nucleoporin-stimulated dissociation of the import complex. These results suggest a biochemical mechanism for Vpr function in transport of the {HIV-1} genome across the nuclear pore complex.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} and other lentiviruses have the unique property among retroviruses to replicate in nondividing cells. This property relies on the use of a nuclear import pathway enabling the viral {DNA} to cross the nuclear membrane of the host cell. In {HIV-1} reverse transcription, a central strand displacement event consecutive to central initiation and termination of plus strand synthesis creates a plus strand overlap: the central {DNA} flap. We show here that the central {DNA} flap acts as a cis-determinant of {HIV-1} {DNA} nuclear import. Wild-type viral linear {DNA} is almost entirely imported into the nucleus where it integrates or circularizes. In contrast, mutant viral {DNA}, which lacks the {DNA} flap, accumulates in infected cells as unintegrated linear {DNA}, at the vicinity of the nuclear membrane. Consistently, {HIV-1} vectors devoid of {DNA} flap exhibit a strong defect of nuclear import, which can be corrected to wild-type levels by reinsertion of the {DNA} flap sequence.},

We introduced specific amino acid substitutions at a number of the conserved residue positions of recombinant {HIV-1} integrase. Some of these substitutions resulted in proteins which were not able to be purified in the same manner as the wild-type enzyme, and these were not studied further. The remaining mutant enzymes were assessed for their abilities to perform functions characteristic of the integrase protein. These included specific removal of the terminal dinucleotides from oligonucleotide substrates representative of the viral U5-long terminal repeat, nonspecific cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates, and mediation of the strand transfer (integration) reaction. Substitution at position 43, within the protein's zinc finger motif region, resulted in an enzyme with reduced specificity for cleavage of the terminal dinucleotide. In addition, a double substitution of aspartic acid and glutamine for valine and glutamic acid, respectively, at positions 151 and 152 within the {D,D(35)E} motif region rendered the integrase protein inactive for all of its functions. The introduction of this double substitution into an infectious {HIV-1} provirus yielded a mutant virus that was incapable of productively infecting human T-lymphoid cells in culture.},

Using an integrase assay with a chemiluminescent readout adapted to a 96-well plate format, the effect of {LEDGF/p75} on both the 3?-processing and strand transfer steps was analyzed. Integrase inhibitors of the strand transfer reaction remained active in the presence of {LEDGF/p75}, but displayed 3- to 7-fold higher {IC50} values. Our analyses indicate that, in the presence of 150 {nM} {LEDGF/p75}, active integrase/donor {DNA} complexes were increased by 5.3-fold during the 3?-processing step. In addition, these integrase/donor {DNA} complexes showed a 4.5-fold greater affinity for the target {DNA} during the subsequent strand transfer step. We also observed a 3.7-fold increase in the rate constant of catalysis of the strand transfer step when 150 {nM} {LEDGF/p75} was present during the 3?-processing step. In contrast, when {LEDGF/p75} was added at the beginning of the strand transfer step, no increase in either the concentration of active integrase/donor {DNA} complex or its rate constant of strand transfer catalysis was observed. This observation suggested that the integrase/donor {DNA} formed in the absence of {LEDGF/p75} became refractory to the stimulatory effect of {LEDGF/p75.} Instead, this {LEDGF/p75} added at the start of the strand transfer step was able to promote the formation of a new cohort of active integrase/donor {DNA} complexes which became functional with a delay of 45 min after {LEDGF/p75} addition. We propose a model whereby {LEDGF/p75} can only bind integrase before the latter binds donor {DNA} whereas donor {DNA} can engage either free or {LEDGF/p75-bound} integrase.},

Fluorescence is partially quenched within an oligonucleotide and the degree of quench is a function of the fluorophore's proximity to purines and Its position In the oligonucleotide. As an example of the potential utility of this class of fluorophores, we developed a continuous assay for {HIV-1} integrase 3-processlng reaction by incorporating 3-{MI} at the cleavage site In a double-stranded oligonucleotide identical to the U5 terminal sequence of the {HIV} genome. Integrase cleaves the 3-terminal dlnucleotide containing the fluorophore, resulting in an increase in fluorescence which can be monitored on a spectrofluorometer. Substitution of the fluorophore for guanosine at the cleavage site does not Inhibit integrase activity. This assay is specific for the 3′-processing reaction. The change in fluorescence intensity is linear over time and proportional to the rate of the reaction. This assay demonstrates the potential utility of this new class of fluorophore for continuous monitoring of {protein/DNA} interactions.},

Accordingly, viruses will hijack and manipulate these proteins utilising any achievable mechanism.

	abstract = {Sequential human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)} isolates, recovered from a panel of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 20 initially asymptomatic {HIV-seropositive} homosexual men, were studied for differences in replication rate, syncytium-inducing capacity, and host range. Eleven individuals remained asymptomatic; nine progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ({AIDS)} or {AIDS-related} complex ({ARC)} at the time point at which the last {HIV} isolate was obtained. In 16 individuals, only non-syncytium-inducing ({NSI)} isolates, with a host range restricted to mononuclear cells, were observed. From four individuals, high-replicating, syncytium-inducing ({SI)} isolates that could be transmitted to the H9, {RC2A}, and U937 cell lines were recovered. From two of these four individuals, {SI} isolates were obtained throughout the observation period. In the two others, a transition from {NSI} to {SI} {HIV} isolates was observed during the period of study. Three of these four individuals developed {ARC} or {AIDS} 9 to 15 months after the first isolation of an {SI} isolate. With the exception of the two individuals in whom a transition from {NSI} to {SI} isolates was observed, within a given individual the replication rate of sequential {HIV} isolates was constant. A significant correlation was found between the mean replication rate of isolates obtained from an individual and the rate of {CD4+} cell decrease observed in this individual. In individuals with low-replicating {HIV} isolates, no significant {CD4+} cell loss was observed. In contrast, recovery of high-replicating isolates, in particular when these were {SI} isolates, was associated with rapid decline of {CD4+} cell numbers and development of {ARC} or {AIDS.} These findings indicate that variability in the biological properties of {HIV} isolates is one of the factors influencing the course of {HIV} infection.},

	abstract = {The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV-1)}, a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of {HIV-1} is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in {HIV-1}, using the {lacZ} alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for {HIV-1} was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for {HIV-1} are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for {HIV-1} is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that {HIV-1} reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.},

	abstract = {We assess the genetic relationships between 49 {HIV-1} group O strains from 24 and 25 patients living in Cameroon and France, respectively. Strains were sequenced in four genomic regions: gag (p24) and three env regions (C2-V3, gp41, and for 22 C2-gp41). In each of the genomic regions analyzed, the genetic diversity among the group O strains was higher than that exhibited by group M. We characterize three major group O phylogenetic clusters ({O:A}, {O:B}, and {O:C)} that comprised the same virus strains in each of the genomic regions analyzed. The majority of strains cluster in {O:A}, a cluster previously identified by analysis of pol and env sequences. Group O recombinants were also identified. Importantly, the distinction between these three major group O clades was weak compared to the strong clustering apparent in the global group M phylogenetic tree that led to the identification of subtypes. Thus, these clusters of group O viruses should not be considered as equivalent to the group M subtypes. This difference between the pattern of group O and the global group M diversity, both taking into account the pandemic status of the group M subtypes and the comparatively small number of group O-infected individuals (the majority being from Cameroon), indicates that the group O phylogeny primarily represents viral divergence in the Cameroon region, analogous to group M viral diversity present in the Democratic Republic of Congo.},

Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of {HIV-1} or {HIV-2}, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of {HIV} infection. Here we describe examples of both {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple {HIV} strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in {HIV-infected} humans and {SIV-infected} primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

The estimated average total {HIV-1} production was 10.3 × 109 virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the {HIV-1} life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average {HIV-1} generation time—defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles—is 2.6 days.

	abstract = {Author Summary 
There are nine different subtypes of the main group of {HIV-1}, each originating as a distinct subepidemic of {HIV-1.} The distribution of subtypes is often unique to a given geographic region of the world and constitutes a useful epidemiological and surveillance resource. The effects of viral subtype on disease progression, treatment outcome and vaccine design are being actively researched, and the importance of accurate subtyping procedures is clear. In {HIV-1}, subtype assignment is complicated by frequent recombination among co-circulating strains, creating new genetic mosaics or recombinant forms: 43 have been characterized to date, and many more likely exist. We present an automated phylogenetic method ({SCUEAL)} to accurately characterize both simple and complex {HIV-1} mosaics. Using computer simulations and biological data we demonstrate that {SCUEAL} performs very well under various conditions, especially when some of the existing classification procedures fail. Furthermore, we show that a small, but noticeable proportion of subtype characterization stored in public databases may be incomplete or incorrect. The computational technique introduced here should provide a much more accurate characterization of {HIV-1} strains, especially novel recombinants, and lead to new insights into molecular history, epidemiology and geographical distribution of the virus.},

	abstract = {Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ({NRTIs)}, such as 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine and 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine, are effective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency type 1 ({HIV-1)} replication. {NRTIs} are deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, but lack a free 3′-hydroxyl group. Once {NRTIs} are incorporated into the nascent viral {DNA}, in reactions catalyzed by {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)}, further viral {DNA} synthesis is effectively terminated. {NRTIs} should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, {HIV-1} inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in {RT.} To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for {HIV-1} {RT} resistance to {NRTIs.} These mechanisms include alterations of {RT} discrimination between {NRTIs} and the analogous {dNTP} (direct effects on {NRTI} binding and/or incorporation), alterations in {RT-template/primer} interactions, which may influence subsequent {NRTI} incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in {RT.} This review discusses the relationship between {HIV-1} drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of {HIV-1} {RT} structure.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground} 
Resistance of {HIV-1} to antiretroviral drugs is the main cause of antiretroviral-treatment failure. We assessed the transmission of drug-resistant variants among individuals with primary {HIV-1} infection. 
Methods 
Population-based sequencing of the viral reverse-transcriptase and protease genes derived from plasma viral {RNA} was done in 82 consecutive individuals with documented primary {HIV-1} infection from January, 1996, to July, 1998. Phenotypic resistance to protease inhibitors was assessed by recombinant virus assay in individuals with two or more mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors. 
Findings 
Zidovudine-resistance mutations were detected in seven (9\%) of 82 individuals. Mutations associated with resistance to other reverse-transcriptase inhibitors ({RTls)} were detected in two individuals. Primary-resistance mutations associated with protease inhibitors ({V82A}, {L90M)} were detected in three (4\%) of 70 individuals; two of these had also {RTl-resistance} mutations. Decreased sensitivity to three or four protease inhibitors was seen in three individuals, one of whom was infected with {HIV-1} variants that harboured 12 mutations associated with resistance to multiple {RTl} and protease inhibitors. 
Interpretation 
To introduce the best antiretroviral treatment, resistance testing should be done in recently {HIV-1-infected} individuals.},

Widespread transmission of drug-resistant variants has the disturbing potential of limiting future therapy options and affecting the efficacy of postexposure prophylaxis
penta increase-spacing 1{\textgreater}{MethodsWe} determined the baseline rate of drug resistance in 2208 therapy-naive patients recently and chronically infected with {HIV-1} from 19 European countries during 1996–2002
{ResultsIn} Europe, 1 of 10 antiretroviral-naive patients carried viruses with ⩾1 drug-resistance mutation. Recently infected patients harbored resistant variants more often than did chronically infected patients (13.5\% vs. 8.7\%; P=.006). Non-B viruses (30\%) less frequently carried resistance mutations than did subtype B viruses (4.8\% vs. 12.9\%; P{\textless}.01). Baseline resistance increased over time in newly diagnosed cases of non-B infection: from 2.0\% (1/49) in 1996–1998 to 8.2\% (16/194) in 2000–2001
{ConclusionsDrug-resistant} variants are frequently present in both recently and chronically infected therapy-naive patients. Drug-resistant variants are most commonly seen in patients infected with subtype B virus, probably because of longer exposure of these viruses to drugs. However, an increase in baseline resistance in non-B viruses is observed. These data argue for testing all drug-naive patients and are of relevance when guidelines for management of postexposure prophylaxis and first-line therapy are updated},

However, as a result of the need for lifelong therapy and {HIV's} prodigious replication rate and error-prone reverse transcriptase, varying amounts of antiretroviral drug resistance are common in treated individuals. Medication adherence is linked to the development of drug resistance, although not by a simple linear relationship. Recent studies have suggested that extensive drug resistance is not a major determinant of {HIV} disease progression and death. Rather, failure to access care and discontinuation of or non-adherence with therapy are arguably the most important factors associated with {HIV} disease progression in the {HAART} era. Other data indicate that continued therapy in the setting of extensive drug resistance and the inability to achieve viral suppression can provide continued clinical benefit. Such benefit may be mediated, at least partially, by reductions in viral fitness associated with drug resistance mutations.},
