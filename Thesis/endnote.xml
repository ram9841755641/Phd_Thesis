Inter-subtype pol diversity encompasses multiple genotypic differences among HIV variants, the consequence of which is unknown. This review summarizes publications from the past year relevant to the impact of HIV diversity on drug resistance evolution and its potential clinical implications. RECENT FINDINGS: The benefit of antiretroviral therapy in non-B infected patients is ongoing, though subtype heterogeneity in rates of disease progression is observed. Pol inter-subtype diversity is high, and known subtype B drug resistance mutations occur in non-B subtypes. New mutations and subtype-specific mutation rates are identified, however, unexplained drug susceptibilities are seen, and additional insight is offered on structural pathogenic mechanisms of resistance in non-B subtypes. These differences may affect genotypic interpretation and our ability to apply drug resistance to patient care. SUMMARY: Current evidence suggests good treatment response and comparable drug resistance evolution in HIV-1 B and non-B infected patients, with increasingly emerging differences. Impact of inter-subtype diversity on drug susceptibility and on evolution of drug resistance should continue to be a major research focus to increase our understanding and ability to improve global patient care.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17075337</NOTES><URL>10.1097/QCO.0b013e3280109122</URL></RECORD>

METHODS: The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV-1 were sequenced, and subtypes were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Each sequence belonging to a non-B variant was matched with a sequence belonging to subtype B. Patterns of resistance mutations were interpreted in terms of drug resistance using the HIV db algorithm. RESULTS: RT mutations M41L, L210W, and, to a lesser extent, T215Y were less prevalent in patients infected with non-B variants. This lower prevalence was associated with subtypes A (A1/A2), C, F (F1/F2), and CRF06\_cpx. A lower prevalence of high-level resistance to zidovudine was also observed in patients infected with these HIV-1 variants. In the protease gene, differences between patients infected with B or non-B strains were mainly observed for mutations playing a minor role in drug resistance and known to occur mainly as a natural polymorphism in non-B strains: K20R/M/I, M36I, L63P, A71V/T, and V77I. Interpretation of genotypes using the HIV db algorithm indicated that resistance to saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and amprenavir was more frequently a high-level resistance for subtype B and an intermediate-level resistance for non-B variants, but this difference was only significant for amprenavir. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the genetic diversity of HIV-1 does not play a major role in the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15097148</NOTES></RECORD>

AIDS can be caused by either of the two human immunodeficiency viruses, HlV-1 and HIV-2. It is estimated that so far around 60 million people have been infected by these viruses, of whom 19 million have died of AIDS (UNAIDS, 2001). Combination antiviral therapies have provided clinical relief to some, but these treatments can have toxic sideeffects, and due to their expense these drugs have not yet been widely available in many of the countries worst affected by AIDS. Given the sudden appearance of AIDS in the 20th century, there is an obvious interest in understanding the origins and evolution of the causative viruses, not least in the context of attempts to prevent further such diseases (Hahn et al., 2000).</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-1157-1_5</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Related but distinct SIVcpz strains have also been found in P. t. schweinfurthii , suggesting that SIVcpz may have coevolved among the four chimpanzee subspecies. However, SIVcpz strains from P. t. verus and P. t. vellerosus have not yet been identified. To better understand the epidemiology and natural history of SIVcpz among chimpanzees, we tested serum samples from 1415 chimpanzees housed at eight U.S. research centers and six zoos. Records indicated that 264 (18.6\%) of the chimpanzees were African-born. Subspecies identities for 161 chimpanzees, based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences, were found to be P. t. troglodytes (n = 14), P. t. schweinfurthii (n = 3), P. t. verus (n = 143), and P. t. vellerosus (n = 1). All samples were screened for HIV/SIV antibodies by using an HIV-1/2 peptide- based enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Reactive samples were tested further by Western blot (WB). Eight sera (0.57\%) were EIA reactive, but none was HIV-1/2 WB positive. Two samples were HIV-1 WB indeterminate. Both samples tested negative for SIVcpz and HIV-1 sequences by reverse transcriptase PCR, suggesting an absence of infection. We also tested sera available from 8 male sexual partners, 6 offspring, and 12 cage mates of a known SIVcpz-infected chimpanzee. All samples were negative, suggesting that SIVcpz may not be easily transmitted to close contacts. Our data show that this large population of chimpanzees is not infected with SIVcpz. The absence of SIVcpz infection in P. t. verus suggests that SIVcpz may not be endemic to this subspecies and implies that SIVcpz may have been introduced more recently into the chimpanzee subspecies following divergence.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15929695</NOTES><URL>10.1089/aid.2005.21.335</URL></RECORD>

We have been using evolutionary comparisons to trace (i) the origin(s) of HIV-1 and (ii) the origin(s) of AIDS. The closest relatives of HIV-1 are simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in west central Africa. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of HIV-1: chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of HIV-1 have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, SIVs are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, SIV and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of SIVs that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that SIV infection causes CD4+ T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of AIDS is more ancient than the origin of HIV-1. Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 20643738 PMCID: PMC2935100</NOTES><URL>10.1098/rstb.2010.0031</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935100/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The receptor binding surfaces of Env are in large part sterically occluded or conformationally masked prior to receptor binding. Knowledge of the unliganded, trimeric Env structure is key for an understanding of viral entry and immune escape, and for the design of vaccines to elicit neutralizing antibodies. We have used cryo-electron tomography and averaging to obtain the structure of the SIV Env complex prior to fusion. Our result reveals novel details of Env organisation, including tight interaction between monomers in the gp41 trimer, associated with a three-lobed, membrane-distal gp120 trimer.

The viral RNA appears to be selected for packaging as a dimer, and there is evidence that dimerization and packaging are mechanistically coupled. Both processes are mediated by interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domains of a small number of assembling viral Gag polyproteins and RNA elements within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the genome. A number of secondary structures have been predicted for regions of the genome that are responsible for packaging, and high-resolution structures have been determined for a few small RNA fragments and protein-RNA complexes. However, major questions remain open regarding the RNA structures, and potentially the structural changes, that are responsible for dimeric genome selection. Here we review efforts that have been made to identify the molecular determinants and mechanism of HIV-1 genome packaging.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 21762803 PMCID: PMC3139105</NOTES><URL>10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.029</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139105/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We have previously presented a cryoelectron microscopic tomogram (cryoET) of the Env spikes on SIV virions. Several structural features were noted in the gp120 head and gp41 stalk regions. Perhaps most notable was the presence of three splayed legs projecting obliquely from the base of the spike head toward the viral membrane. Subsequently, a second 3D image of SIV spikes, also obtained by cryoET, was published by another group which featured a compact vertical stalk. We now report the cryoET analysis of HIV-1 virion-associated Env spikes using enhanced analytical cryoET procedures. More than 2,000 Env spike volumes were initially selected, aligned, and sorted into structural classes using algorithms that compensate for the “missing wedge” and do not impose any symmetry. The results show varying morphologies between structural classes: some classes showed trimers in the head domains; nearly all showed two or three legs, though unambiguous three-fold symmetry was not observed either in the heads or the legs. Subsequently, clearer evidence of trimeric head domains and three splayed legs emerged when head and leg volumes were independently aligned and classified. These data show that HIV-1, like SIV, also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and, unexpectedly, shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. The tripod-like model for gp41 is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region., The envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1 and SIV virions facilitate target cell tropism, binding, and entry, and serve as the sole targets of humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity. X-ray crystallography has previously revealed the atomic structures of key core domains and peptides of the gp120 and gp41 Env spike subunits, but the manner by which these components are arranged in the Env spike is still speculative. Cryoelectron tomography (cryoET) affords a view of the entire Env spike in the context of the intact virion. We have previously published a cryoET model of the SIV Env spike which showed a unique tripod-like leg configuration for the solvent-exposed (external) gp41 stalk region. This model is consistent with, and helps explain, many of the unique biophysical and immunological features of this region. Subsequently another group using similar technology and virions reported a spike model displaying a compact gp41 stalk inconsistent with our splayed-leg spike model. In this report, we apply enhanced analytical cryoET procedures to show that HIV-1 also displays the tripod-like leg configuration, and shows considerable gp41 leg flexibility/heteromorphology. These results have implications for the design of effective vaccines targeting this region and may provide new insights into Env spike function.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19008954 PMCID: PMC2577619</NOTES><URL>10.1371/journal.ppat.1000203</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577619/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

When psi was at its wild-type position (in SVX virus) near the 5' end of the RNA, the titer of infectious virus production was 5 X 10(6) G-418-resistant CFU per ml. The titer was decreased approximately fivefold when psi was moved, in its proper orientation, to near the 3' end of the virus (SVX-psi C) and was decreased approximately 600-fold when psi was moved, in its proper orientation, into the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. When psi was deleted (SVX-psi-) or inserted in the opposite orientation at either of these two positions, the titer was decreased by 3000-fold relative to SVX. In SVX-psi C, psi was no longer in the intron (as it is in SVX and Moloney murine leukemia virus) but was moved to a region which is only exonic. This resulted in the encapsidation of both spliced and unspliced RNAs, their efficient reverse transcription, and their integration into the genome of an infected cell. A number of proviruses resulting from integration of either spliced or unspliced RNAs were cloned. Four of these clones were subjected to sequence analysis in the region of the splice sites, and it was determined which sites are used by these viruses and also which are used by Moloney murine leukemia virus.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 3989912 PMCID: PMC254810</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC254810/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Our data indicate that, for RNA encapsidation, there are at least two functional subregions in the leader region. One subregion is located at a position immediately proximal to the major splice donor, and the second is located between the splice donor and the beginning of the gag gene. This suggests that at least two discrete cis-acting elements are recognition signals for encapsidation. To determine whether specific putative RNA secondary structures serve as the signal(s) for encapsidation, we constructed primary base substitution mutations that would be expected to destabilize these potential structures and second-site compensatory mutations that would restore secondary structure. Analysis of these mutants allowed the identification of two discrete hairpins that facilitate RNA encapsidation in vivo. Thus, the HIV-1 E/psi region is a multipartite element composed of specific and functional RNA secondary structures. Compensation of the primary mutations by the second-site mutations could not be attained in trans. This indicates that interstrand base pairing between these two stem regions within the hairpins does not appear to be the basis for HIV-1 RNA dimer formation. Comparison of the hypothetical RNA secondary structures from 10 replication-competent HIV-1 strains suggests that a subset of the hydrogen-bonded base pairs within the stems of the hairpins is likely to be required for function in cis.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8627772 PMCID: PMC190155</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC190155/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Recent phylogenetic studies identified base pair complementarity between residues of the unique 5′ element and those near the gag start codon (gagAUG) that is conserved among evolutionarily distant retroviruses, suggesting a potential long-range RNA-RNA interaction. However, nucleotide accessibility studies led to conflicting conclusions about the presence of such interactions in virions and in infected cells. Here we show that an 11-nucleotide oligo-RNA spanning residues 105-115 of the 5′-UTR (U5) readily binds to oligoribonucleotides containing the gag start codon (AUG), disrupting a pre-existing stem loop and forming a heteroduplex stabilized by 11 Watson Crick base pairs (Kd = 0.47 ± 0.16 μM). Addition of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC), the transacting viral factor required for genome packaging, disrupts the heteroduplex by binding tightly to U5 (Kd = 122 ± 10 nM). The structure of the NC:U5 complex, determined by NMR, exhibits features similar to those observed in NC complexes with HIV-1 stem loop RNAs, including the insertion of guanosine nucleobases to hydrophobic clefts on the surface of the zinc fingers and a 3′-to-5′ orientation of the RNA relative to protein. Our findings indicate that the previously proposed long-range U5-gagAUG interaction is feasible, and suggest a potential NC-dependent mechanism for modulating the structure of the 5′-UTR.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19006324 PMCID: PMC2646082</NOTES><URL>10.1021/bi8014373</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646082/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Complete amino acid sequences were determined for the mature Gag proteins, showing natural proteolytic cleavage sites and the order of proteins (p17-p24-p2-p7-p1-p6) in the Gag precursors. At least two sequence variants of p24 and eight sequence variants of p17 were detected. The two most abundant variants of p24 and p17 represented at least 50\% +/- 5\% and 20\% +/- 5\% of their totals, respectively. These data suggest heterogeneity in the virus population, with 50\% of the total virus containing the most abundant forms of p17 and p24 and 20\% of the virus containing the second most abundant forms. The Gag precursors of these suggested viruses differ from each other by only 3 amino acid residues but differ from the precursors predicted by the published MN proviral DNA sequence by 10 residues. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the purified p24 forms showed that the measured molecular weight of the protein was 200 +/- 50 atomic mass units greater than the calculated molecular weight. The source of additional mass for the p24 forms was not determined, but the observation is consistent with previous suggestions that the protein is phosphorylated. Greater than 98\% of the total recovered p17 was myristylated at the N-terminal glycine residue, and the measured molecular weights (as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) of the most abundant forms were within 3 atomic mass units of the calculated molecular weights (15,266).</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1548743</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/66/4/1856</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

During natural infection, gp120 is a primary target of the humoral immune response, and it has evolved to resist antibody-mediated neutralization. We previously reported the structure at 2.5 Å of a gp120 core from the HXBc2 laboratory-adapted isolate in complex with a 2 domain fragment of CD4 and the antigen binding fragment of a human antibody. This revealed atomic details of gp120-receptor interactions and suggested multiple mechanisms of immune evasion. Results: We have now extended the HXBc2 structure in P2221 crystals to 2.2 Å. The enhanced resolution enabled a more accurate modeling of less-well-ordered regions and provided conclusive identification of the density in the central cavity at the crux of the gp120-CD4 interaction as isopropanol from the crystallization medium. We have also determined the structure of a gp120 core from the primary clinical HIV-1 isolate, YU2, in the same ternary complex but in a C2 crystal lattice. Comparisons of HXBc2 and YU2 showed that while CD4 binding was rigid, portions of the gp120 core were conformationally flexible; overall differences were minor, with sequence changes concentrated on a surface expected to be exposed on the envelope oligomer. Conclusions: Despite dramatic antigenic differences between primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1, the gp120 cores from these isolates are remarkably similar. Taken together with chimeric substitution and sequence analysis, this indicates that neutralization resistance is specified by quaternary interactions involving the major variable loops and thus affords a mechanism for viral adaptation. Conservation of the central cavity suggests the possibility of therapeutic inhibitors. The structures reported here extend in detail and generality our understanding of the biology of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00547-5</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212600005475</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

It is the main driving force for the generation of drug resistance and the escape from immune surveillance. G to A hypermutation is one of the characteristics of primate lentiviruses, as well as other retroviruses, during replication in vivo and in cell culture. The molecular mechanisms of this process, however, remain to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that CEM15 (also known as apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G; APOBEC3G), an endogenous inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication, is a cytidine deaminase and is able to induce G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. This effect can be counteracted by the HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). It seems that this viral DNA mutator is a viral defence mechanism in host cells that may induce either lethal hypermutation or instability of the incoming nascent viral reverse transcripts, which could account for the Vif-defective phenotype. Importantly, the accumulation of CEM15-mediated non-lethal hypermutation in the replicating viral genome could potently contribute to the genetic variation of primate lentiviral populations.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nature01707</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v424/n6944/full/nature01707.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The Vif (virion infectivity factor) proteins are encoded by primate immunodeficiency viruses, most notably human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). These proteins are potent regulators of virus infection and replication and are consequently essential for pathogenic infections in vivo. HIV-1 Vif seems to be required during the late stages of virus production for the suppression of an innate antiviral phenotype that resides in human T lymphocytes. Thus, in the absence of Vif, expression of this phenotype renders progeny virions non-infectious. Here, we describe a unique cellular gene, CEM15, whose transient or stable expression in cells that do not normally express CEM15 recreates this phenotype, but whose antiviral action is overcome by the presence of Vif. Because the Vif:CEM15 regulatory circuit is critical for HIV-1 replication, perturbing the circuit may be a promising target for future HIV/AIDS therapies.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nature00939</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/nature00939.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here we provide evidence that the virion infectivity factor protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) functions to counteract a newly discovered activity in human cells that otherwise inhibits virus replication. This anti-viral phenotype is shown by human T cells, the principal in vivo targets for HIV-1, and, based on our present understanding of virion infectivity factor action, is presumed to act by interfering with a late step(s) in the virus life cycle. These observations indicate that the inhibition of virion infectivity factor function in vivo may prevent HIV-1 replication by 'unmasking' an innate anti-viral phenotype.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/3987</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nm/journal/v4/n12/full/nm1298_1397.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

It had been proposed that permissive cells may contain an unidentified factor that functions like the viral Vif protein. To test this hypothesis, we produced pseudotyped wild-type and vif-deleted HIV gpt virions (which contain the HIV-1 genome with the bacterial mycophenolic acid resistance gene gpt in place of the viral env gene) in permissive cells, and we used them to generate nonpermissive H9 leukemic T cells that express these proviruses. We then fused these H9 cells with permissive HeLa cells that express the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41, and we asked whether the heterokaryons would release infectious HIV gpt virions. The results clearly showed that the vif-deleted virions released by the heterokaryons were noninfectious whereas the wild-type virions were highly infectious. This strongly suggests that nonpermissive cells, the natural targets of HIV-1, contain a potent endogenous inhibitor of HIV-1 replication that is overcome by Vif.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9811770</NOTES></RECORD>

Vif was found to be essential for the spread of HIV-1 in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in primary macrophages, as well as in some but not all established T-cell lines. Vif was required at the stage of viral particle formation, for cell-to-cell as well as for cell-free transmission of HIV-1. Accordingly, vif-defective viruses could be complemented by the expression of vif in the producer but not in the target cell. vif-defective virions contained wild-type amounts of Gag and Env proteins, reverse transcriptase, integrase, genomic RNA, and partial reverse transcripts. Most importantly, they could enter cells normally, and the vif defect could not be rescued through the use of HIV(MLV [murine leukemia virus]) pseudotypes. Instead, vif-mutant viruses were severely impaired in their ability to complete the synthesis of proviral DNA, once internalized in the target cell. These results suggest that Vif plays a role which is novel for a retroviral protein, in allowing the processing and/or the transport of the internalized HIV core.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8331734</NOTES></RECORD>

First, it regulates virus release from a post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment by an ion channel activity mediated by its transmembrane anchor. Second, it induces the selective down regulation of host cell receptor proteins (CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules) in a process involving its phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail. In the present work, we show that the Vpu-induced proteolysis of nascent CD4 can be completely blocked by peptide aldehydes that act as competitive inhibitors of proteasome function and also by lactacystin, which blocks proteasome activity by covalently binding to the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes. The sensitivity of Vpu-induced CD4 degradation to proteasome inhibitors paralleled the inhibition of proteasome degradation of a model ubiquitinated substrate. Characterization of CD4-associated oligosaccharides indicated that CD4 rescued from Vpu-induced degradation by proteasome inhibitors is exported from the ER to the Golgi complex. This finding suggests that retranslocation of CD4 from the ER to the cytosol may be coupled to its proteasomal degradation. CD4 degradation mediated by Vpu does not require the ER chaperone calnexin and is dependent on an intact ubiquitin-conjugating system. This was demonstrated by inhibition of CD4 degradation (i) in cells expressing a thermally inactivated form of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 or (ii) following expression of a mutant form of ubiquitin (Lys48 mutated to Arg48) known to compromise ubiquitin targeting by interfering with the formation of polyubiquitin complexes. CD4 degradation was also prevented by altering the four Lys residues in its cytosolic domain to Arg, suggesting a role for ubiquitination of one or more of these residues in the process of degradation. The results clearly demonstrate a role for the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the process of Vpu-induced CD4 degradation. In contrast to other viral proteins (human cytomegalovirus US2 and US11), however, whose translocation of host ER molecules into the cytosol occurs in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, Vpu-targeted CD4 remains in the ER in a transport-competent form when proteasome activity is blocked.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9499087</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/72/3/2280</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

A second role for Vpr was recently suggested by Rogel et al. (M. E. Rogel, L. I. Wu, and M. Emerman, J. Virol. 69:882-888, 1995), who showed that Vpr prevents the establishment in vitro of chronically infected HIV producer cell lines, apparently by causing infected cells to arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In cycling cells, progression from G2 to M phase is driven by activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex, an event caused, in part, by dephosphorylation of two regulatory amino acids of p34cdc2 (Thr-14 and Tyr-15). We show here that Vpr arrests the cell cycle in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex. Vpr expression in cells caused p34cdc2 to remain in the phosphorylated, inactive state, p34cdc2/cyclin B complexes immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Vpr were almost completely inactive in a histone H1 kinase assay. Coexpression of a constitutively active mutant p34cdc2 molecule with Vpr relieved the G2 arrest. These findings strongly suggest that Vpr arrests cells in G2 by preventing the activation of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex that is required for entry into M phase. In vivo, Vpr might, by preventing p34cdc2 activation, delay or prevent apoptosis of infected cells. This would increase the amount of virus each infected cell produced.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7474080</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/69/11/6705</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Unlike the other lentivirus regulatory proteins, Vpr is present in virions at relatively high copy number. In cells, Vpr is localized to the nucleus. Possible functions for vpr consistent with these findings include the nuclear import of preintegration complexes, transactivation of cellular genes, or induction of cellular differentiation. We show here, using both replication competent, macrophage-tropic virus and a sensitive, single-cycle luciferase HIV-1 reporter vector, that vpr is important for efficient viral replication in primary monocyte/macrophages, but appears to play no role in activated or resting T cell infection. The block to infection in monocytes was localized by PCR analysis of newly synthesized viral DNA and with the luciferase reporter vector to a stage in the viral life cycle after entry and reverse transcription, yet prior to, or at the time of, proviral transcription. In addition, infection of mononuclear phagocytes with virions that had been loaded with Vpr molecules in the producer cells by trans-complementation still showed a vpr-phenotype. These data suggest a role for vpr molecules produced in newly infected cells, in addition to its presumed function in the virion.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/viro.1995.1016</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285710161</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The requirement for Nef during viral biogenesis particles suggests that Nef might play a role in this process. Alternatively, because Nef is incorporated into viruses, it might play a role when progeny virions reach target cells. We challenged these hypotheses by manipulating the amounts of Nef incorporated in viruses while keeping its expression level constant in producer cells. This was achieved by forcing the incorporation of Nef into viral particles by fusing a Vpr sequence to the C-terminal end of Nef. A cleavage site for the viral protease was introduced between Nef and Vpr to allow the release of Nef fragments from the fusion protein during virus maturation. We show that the resulting Nef-CS-Vpr fusion partially retains the ability of Nef to downregulate cell surface CD4 and that high amounts of Nef-CS-Vpr are incorporated into viral particles compared with what is seen for wild-type Nef. The fusion protein is processed during virion maturation and releases Nef fragments similar to those found in viruses produced in the presence of wild-type Nef. Unlike viruses produced in the presence of wild-type Nef, viruses produced in the presence of Nef-CS-Vpr do not have an increase in infectivity and are as poorly infectious as viruses produced in the absence of Nef. These findings demonstrate that the presence of Nef in viral particles is not sufficient to increase human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity and suggest that Nef plays a role during the biogenesis of viral particles.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 18987145</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.01633-08</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/83/2/1093</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, class I downregulation potentially exposes the virus-infected cell to attack by NK cells. Human lymphoid cells are protected from NK cell cytotoxicity primarily by HLA-C and HLA-E. We present evidence that HIV-1 selectively downregulates HLA-A and HLA-B but does not significantly affect HLA-C or HLA-E. We then identify the residues in HLA-C and HLA-E that protect them from HIV down-regulation. This selective downregulation allows HIV-infected cells to avoid NK cell-mediated lysis and may represent for HIV a balance between escape from CTL and maintenance of protection from NK cells.

To resolve this enigma, we have examined the ability of CTLs to recognize and kill infected primary T lymphocytes. We found that CTLs inefficiently lysed primary cells infected with HIV-1 if the viral nef gene product was expressed. Resistance of infected cells to CTL killing correlated with nef-mediated downregulation of MHC class I and could be overcome by adding an excess of the relevant HIV-1 epitope as soluble peptide. Thus, Nef protected infected cells by reducing the epitope density on their surface. This effect of nef may allow evasion of CTL lysis by HIV-1-infected cells.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9450757</NOTES><URL>10.1038/34929</URL></RECORD>

Nef is not necessary for viral replication in vitro and stimulates the endocytosis of CD4. We show that the expression of MHC-I at the surface of lymphoid, monocytic and epithelial cells was reduced in the presence of Nef protein from various HIV-1 strains. Whereas MHC-I protein synthesis and transport through the endoplasmic reticulum and cis Golgi apparatus occurred normally in Nef(+) cells, surface MHC-I molecules were rapidly internalized, accumulated in endosomal vesicles and were degraded.

Nef-mediated down-modulation of HLA class I on infected cells can confer resistance to CTL clearance, but the factors determining the efficiency of this process are unknown. This study examines the impact of Nef on the antiviral activity of several CTL clones recognizing epitopes from early and late HIV-1 proteins, restricted by HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules. CTL-targeting epitopes in early proteins remained susceptible to the effects of Nef, although possibly to a lesser degree than CTL-targeting late protein epitopes, indicating that significant Nef-mediated HLA down-regulation can precede even the presentation of early protein-derived epitopes. However, HLA-C–restricted CTLs were unaffected by Nef, consistent with down-regulation of cell-surface HLA-A and -B but not HLA-C molecules. Thus, CTLs vary dramatically in their susceptibility to Nef interference, suggesting differences in the relative importance of HLA-A– and HLA-B– versus HLA-C–restricted CTLs in vivo. The data thus indicate that HLA-C–restricted CTLs may have an under-appreciated antiviral role in the setting of Nef in vivo and suggest a benefit of promoting HLA-C–restricted CTLs for immunotherapy or vaccine development.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16882705</NOTES><URL>10.1182/blood-2006-06-030668</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/108/10/3414</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We confirmed this effect by using a nef-mutant HIV-1 strain (NL-M20A) that expresses a Nef protein which does not induce down-regulation of HLA class I molecules but is otherwise functional. HIV-1-specific CTL clones were not able to kill primary CD4+ T cells infected with a Nef-positive HIV-1 strain (NL-432) but efficiently lysed CD4+ T cells infected with NL-M20A. Interestingly, CTL clones stimulated with NL-432-infected CD4+ T cells were able to produce cytokines, albeit at a lower level than when stimulated with NL-M20A-infected CD4+ T cells. This indicates that Nef-mediated HLA class I down-regulation affects CTL cytokine production to a lesser extent than cytolytic activity. Replication of NL-432 was partially suppressed in a coculture of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HIV-1-specific CTL clones, while replication of NL-M20A was completely suppressed. These results suggest that HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells are able to partially suppress the replication of HIV-1 through production of soluble HIV-1-suppressive factors such as chemokines and gamma interferon. These findings may account for the mechanism whereby HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells are able to partially but not completely control HIV-1 replication in vivo.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12097566</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.76.15.7535-7543.2002</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/15/7535</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

How Nef accomplishes the balance between such conflicting selective pressures remains elusive. By genetic and functional studies, we found that Arg75Thr and Tyr85Phe mutations, located in a well-conserved proline-rich region in Nef, were differently associated with escape from CTL responses specific for two overlapping HLA-B35-restricted epitopes. CTLs specific for an epitope, that selected Tyr85Phe, were elicited earlier and had more potent functional avidities than did those that selected Arg75Thr. Although the double mutant could escape from both CTLs, the mutations are rarely observed in combination naturally. Introduction of both mutations reduced Nef’s HLA class I down-regulation activity and increased the susceptibility of virus-infected cells to recognition by CTLs targeting other epitopes. Moreover, the mutant Nef was impaired in the association with activated cellular kinases and in the enhancement of viral replication. These results highlight CTL immunosurveillance as important modulators of Nef’s biological activity in the infected host.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 18178851</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jimmunol.org/content/180/2/1107</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In a previous report we identified an immunodominant region (amino acids 73-144) in the NEF protein that was recognized by CD8+ class I-restricted CTL of most asymptomatic individuals. Analysis of the 73-144 region by peptide sensitization, experiments using overlapping peptides corresponding to the LAI isolate identified the peptide sequences located between residues 73 and 82 or 84 and 92 and the peptide sequence between residues 134 and 144 as cognate peptides for HLA-A11- and HLA-B18-restricted epitopes, respectively. This report describes the variable demonstrable reactivities of CTL obtained from HLA-A11 or HLA-B18 seropositive, asymptomatic patients who all had a response to the virus NEF protein, but who did not always recognize appropriate cognate peptides. The high mutation rate of HIV probably facilitates the selection of mutants that can avoid the cellular immune response. We therefore analyzed the variability of these epitopes restricted by HLA-A11 and HLA-B18. We sequenced several viral isolates from HLA-A11 and HLA-B18 donors who recognized certain HLA-peptide complexes and from those who did not. A CTL sensitization assay was used to show that some mutations led to a great reduction in CTL activity in vitro. This might be due to failure of the mutated epitope to bind major histocompatibility complex class I molecule. A simple assay was used to detect peptides that promoted the assembly of class I molecules. Some of these mutations at major anchor positions prevented HLA-A11/peptide binding, and consequently impaired recognition of the HLA-peptide complex by the T cell receptor.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7520468</NOTES><URL>10.1084/jem.180.3.1129</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jem.rupress.org/content/180/3/1129</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Such functional convergence strongly suggests that CD4 downregulation is critical for optimal viral replication, yet the significance of this phenomenon has so far remained a puzzle. RESULTS: We show that high levels of CD4 on the surface of HIV-infected cells induce a dramatic reduction in the infectivity of released virions by the sequestering of the viral envelope by CD4. CD4 is able to accumulate in viral particles while at the same time blocking incorporation of Env into the virion. Nef and Vpu, through their ability to downregulate CD4, counteract this effect. CONCLUSIONS: The CD4-mediated 'envelope interference' described here probably explains the plurality of mechanisms developed by HIV to downregulate the cell-surface expression of its receptor.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10375528</NOTES></RECORD>

Deletion mutants corresponding to 86 and 35 N-terminal residues of the Nef protein were prepared. The GST-Nef constructs were used to identify cellular kinases capable of interacting with Nef. After incubation with a Jurkat cell lysate, the GST-Nef constructs immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads bound to cellular kinase(s) and were phosphorylated at three sites in vitro: one on threonine at position 15, one on serine between residues 1 and 35, and one on threonine between residues 36 and 86. The Nef-phosphorylating activity was inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC)-selective inhibitors. Cell fractionation showed that this Nef-binding kinase was mainly in the membrane-associated fraction. These results suggest that kinase(s) of the PKC family are specifically bound to and phosphorylate Nef in vitro. The interaction of Nef with cellular kinases and its phosphorylation may be important in mediating the effects of Nef in HIV-1 pathogenesis.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7540194</NOTES><URL>10.1099/0022-1317-76-6-1337</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/76/6/1337</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Negative, positive, and no effects of Nef have also been reported on viral replication in cells. To reconcile these observations, we expressed a hybrid CD8-Nef protein in Jurkat cells. Two opposite phenotypes were found, which depended on the intracellular localization of Nef. Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface, the chimera inhibited or activated early signaling events from the T cell antigen receptor. Activated Jurkat cells died by apoptosis, and only cells with mutated nef genes expressing truncated Nefs survived, which rendered Nef nonfunctional. These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro. Not only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation, but they also explain effects of Nef in HIV infection and progression to AIDS.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7882168</NOTES></RECORD>

The recently reported association of Nef with an unidentified serine kinase provides a clue as to how Nef might exert its effects. Considering the key role of protein kinase C (PKC) in T cell activation, we investigated the possibility that Nef interacts with PKC. Our results, using two approaches for detecting interactions between Nef and PKC isozymes in Jurkat cells, show that Nef interacts preferentially with θPKC. The interaction of Nef and θPKC is independent of calcium, enhanced by phospholipid activators of PKC and not affected by a PKC pseudosubstrate peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing Nef fails to produce the usual translocation of θPKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction; translocation of βPKC and ϵPKC was unaffected. Indeed, there appears to be a net loss of θPKC in Nef-expressing cells following stimulation. The loss of θPKC, which may be a result of inhibition of its binding to RACKs due to Nef binding, could contribute to the various impairments of T cell function associated with HIV infection and Nef expression.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8663223</NOTES><URL>10.1074/jbc.271.28.16753</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jbc.org/content/271/28/16753</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

By comparing nef-competent and nef-deleted HIV-1 strains in an in vitro coculture system, we demonstrate that the presence of this viral accessory gene leads to impairment of the ability of HIV-1-specific CTL clones to suppress viral replication. Furthermore, inhibition by genetically modified CTL that do not require major histocompatibility complex class I-presented antigen (expressing the CD4 T-cell receptor [TCR] ζ-chain hybrid receptor) is similar for both nef-competent and -deleted strains, indicating that Nef does not impair the effector functions of CTL but acts at the level of TCR triggering. In contrast, we note that another accessory gene, vpr, does not induce resistance of HIV-1 to suppression by CTL clones. We conclude that Nef (and not Vpr) contributes to functional HIV-1 immune evasion and that this effect is mediated by diminished antigen presentation to CTL.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11799157</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.76.4.1626-1631.2002</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/4/1626</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

IN juxtaposes two DNA blunt ends to form the synaptic complex, which is the intermediate in the concerted integration pathway. The synaptic complex is inactivated by strand transfer inhibitors (STI) with IC50 values of ∼ 20 nM for inhibition of concerted integration. We detected a new nucleoprotein complex on a native agarose gel that was produced in the presence of &#x0026;gt; 200 nM STI, termed the IN–single DNA (ISD) complex. Two IN dimers appear to bind in a parallel fashion at the DNA terminus, producing an ∼ 32-bp DNase I protective footprint. In the presence of raltegravir (RAL), MK-2048, and L-841,411, IN incorporated ∼ 20–25\% of the input blunt-ended DNA substrate into the stabilized ISD complex. Seven other STI also produced the ISD complex (≤ 5\% of input DNA). The formation of the ISD complex was not dependent on 3′OH processing, and the DNA was predominantly blunt ended in the complex. The RAL-resistant IN mutant N155H weakly forms the ISD complex in the presence of RAL at ∼ 25\% level of wild-type IN. In contrast, MK-2048 and L-841,411 produced ∼ 3-fold to 5-fold more ISD than RAL with N155H IN, which is susceptible to these two inhibitors. The results suggest that STI are slow-binding inhibitors and that the potency to form and stabilize the ISD complex is not always related to inhibition of concerted integration. Rather, the apparent binding and dissociation properties of each STI influenced the production of the ISD complex.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.jmb.2011.01.043</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611000994</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Soluble CD4 (sCD4) is thought to mimic membrane-anchored CD4, and its binding alters the conformation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. Two cross-competing monoclonal antibodies, 17b and CG10, that recognize CD4-inducible gp120 epitopes and that block gp120-chemokine receptor binding were used to investigate the nature and functional significance of gp120 conformational changes initiated by CD4 binding. Envelope glycoproteins derived from both T-cell line-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates exhibited increased binding of the 17b antibody in the presence of sCD4. CD4-induced exposure of the 17b epitope on the oligomeric envelope glycoprotein complex occurred over a wide range of temperatures and involved movement of the gp120 V1/V2 variable loops. Amino acid changes that reduced the efficiency of 17b epitope exposure following CD4 binding invariably compromised the ability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to form syncytia or to support virus entry. Comparison of the CD4 dependence and neutralization efficiencies of the 17b and CG10 antibodies suggested that the epitopes for these antibodies are minimally accessible following attachment of gp120 to cell surface CD4. These results underscore the functional importance of these CD4-induced changes in gp120 conformation and illustrate viral strategies for sequestering chemokine receptor-binding regions from the humoral immune response.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9573233</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/72/6/4694</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Recombinant CC CKR5, a G protein-coupled receptor for these chemokines, rendered CD4-expressing nonhuman cells fusion-competent preferentially with macrophage-tropic Envs. CC CKR5 messenger RNA was detected selectively in cell types susceptible to macrophage-tropic isolates.

Observation of the GFP-labeled particles in living cells revealed that they moved in curvilinear paths in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region, often near the microtubule-organizing center. Further studies show that HIV uses cytoplasmic dynein and the microtubule network to migrate toward the nucleus. By combining GFP fused to the NH2 terminus of HIV-1 Vpr tagging with other labeling techniques, it was possible to determine the state of progression of individual particles through the viral life cycle. Correlation of immunofluorescent and electron micrographs allowed high resolution imaging of microtubule-associated structures that are proposed to be reverse transcription complexes. Based on these observations, we propose that HIV uses dynein and the microtubule network to facilitate the delivery of the viral genome to the nucleus of the cell during early postentry steps of the HIV life cycle.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12417576</NOTES><URL>10.1083/jcb.200203150</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jcb.rupress.org/content/159/3/441</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

HIV uses a complex series of steps to deliver its genome into the host cell cytoplasm while simultaneously evading the host immune response. To infect cells, the HIV protein envelope (Env) binds to the primary cellular receptor CD4 and then to a cellular coreceptor. This sequential binding triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, initiating infection. Revealing the mechanism of HIV entry has profound implications for viral tropism, transmission, pathogenesis, and therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide an overview into the mechanism of HIV entry, provide historical context to key discoveries, discuss recent advances, and speculate on future directions in the field.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 22908191</NOTES><URL>10.1101/cshperspect.a006866</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/2/8/a006866</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Recently, several studies suggested that ERT of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) might occur without detergent treatment. However, this phenomenon could be due to damage of the retroviral envelope during the process of virion purification or freezing and thawing. In this report, intravirion HIV-1 ERT, without detergent-induced permeabilization, is demonstrated to occur in the natural microenvironments of HIV-1 virions and is not caused by artificial processes. Therefore, this stage of the viral life cycle was termed natural ERT (NERT). The efficiency of NERT in HIV-1 virions was markedly augmented by several physiological substances in the extracellular milieu, such as polyamines and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. In addition, HIV-1 virions in seminal plasma samples harbored dramatically higher levels of full-length or nearly full-length reverse transcripts than virions isolated from peripheral blood plasma samples of HIV-1-seropositive men. When HIV-1 virions were incubated with seminal plasma samples, infectivity in initially nondividing cells was also significantly enhanced. Thus, we suggest that HIV-1 virions are actively altered by the extracellular microenvironment and that NERT may play an important role in viral infection of nondividing cells.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8627755</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/70/5/2809</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

RNA encapsidation by retroviruses is a remarkable process by which the virus negotiates the trafﬁcking of a minority species of mRNA through a particular cellular pathway to become its genome. During this, in the case of HIV, it may ﬁrst be translated before being selected by the viral Gag protein, highly speciﬁcally, from the cellular background pool of mRNAs. These processes involve the recognition of RNA secondary and tertiary structures and an RNA–RNA intermolecular interaction to package a diploid dimeric RNA genome. RNA transport and encapsidation involves cellular chaper-one proteins of which, as yet, few are identiﬁed. The structural detail of the interaction between the viral RNA and the Gag protein is described in the chapter. This process requires ﬂexibility and conformational change in the RNA and reﬂects the fact that transport from transcriptional site to virion likely involves the genomic RNA adopting a number of different structures to display the relevant stage‐speciﬁc cis‐acting signals. The speciﬁcity of this process and the virus‐speciﬁc nature of RNA export from a cell make these processes attractive therapeutic targets.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054358907550015</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Although most of the components of the retroviral particle have been identified (see Fig. 1 and Chapter 2), the molecular details of the assembly mechanisms are poorly understood. This may seem surprising since the number of distinct proteins contained in a retrovirus is small. What makes the process of assembly both difficult and interesting to study is its highly dynamic nature. An examination of the mature retroviral particle cannot fully explain the steps in assembly because these components are not those from which the particle was made. Rather, all of the structural proteins of the virion, with few exceptions, are derived from three polyproteins: Gag, Gag-Pro-Pol, and Env (Fig. 2). Each of these precursor proteins has special characteristics needed for specific steps in the assembly process, and each undergoes extensive changes along the way. In brief, the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) proteins found on the surface of the virion are initially synthesized as a single polypeptide, the Env glycoprotein, which is assembled into oligomeric complexes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), extensively modified, and then cleaved by a cell-encoded protease during transport to the surface of the cell. In some instances, further proteolytic processing of TM occurs after the particle is released. Likewise, the proteins found on the inside the virion (matrix, MA; capsid, CA; nucleocapsid, NC; protease, PR; reverse transcriptase, RT; integrase, IN) are initially linked within the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol proteins. The Gag protein is sufficient for directing budding at the plasma membrane, and the Pro-Pol polyproteins are incorporated into the resulting particle because they are linked to Gag. Subsequent cleavage of the Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol proteins by the viral protease brings about new shapes and arrangements inside the nascent virion as the immature particle undergoes a metamorphosis into the mature, infectious retrovirus. Even the structure of the viral RNA, packaged into the virion through an interaction with Gag, changes during the budding and maturation process.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 21433349</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19456/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Proteolysis of its main structural component, Gag, is required for morphological maturation and infectivity and leads to release of four functional domains and the spacer peptides SP1 and SP2. The N-terminal cleavages of Gag and the separation of SP1 from CA are all essential for viral infectivity, while the roles of the two C-terminal cleavages and the role of SP2, separating the NC and p6 domains, are less well defined. We have analyzed HIV-1 variants with defective cleavage at either or both sites flanking SP2, or largely lacking SP2, regarding virus production, infectivity, and structural maturation. Neither the presence nor the proteolytic processing of SP2 was required for particle release. Viral infectivity was almost abolished when both cleavage sites were defective and severely reduced when the fast cleavage site between SP2 and p6 was defective. This correlated with an increased proportion of irregular core structures observed by cryo-electron tomography, although processing of CA was unaffected. Mutation of the slow cleavage site between NC and SP2 or deletion of most of SP2 had only a minor effect on infectivity and did not induce major alterations in mature core morphology. We speculate that not only separation of NC and p6 but also the processing kinetics in this region are essential for successful maturation, while SP2 itself is dispensable.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 23055560</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.01704-12</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/86/24/13708</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In the last years, however, the HIV-1 transmission rate among heterosexuals has dramatically increased, becoming the prevalent transmission route. In fact, while the traditional risk groups have high levels of knowledge and avoid high-risk practices, the heterosexuals do not sufficiently perceive the risk of HIV-1 infection. This misperception, linked to the growing number of immigrants from non-Western Countries, where non-B clades and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are prevalent, is progressively introducing HIV-1 variants of non-B subtype in the Italian epidemic.

HIV-1-specific PCR products were obtained in seven of seven randomly chosen doubly reactive cases, while HIV-2-specific sequences were detected in five of seven cases (71\%). DNA sequence analysis showed that the HIV-1 gp120 coding sequences were closely related to each other (nucleotide sequence divergence of between 3.1 and 6.8\%). Phylogenetic tree analysis placed the Indian strains within the C subtype of HIV-1, being most similar to sequences previously found in East and South Africa. The HIV-2 sequences were also closely related to each other, with an overall sequence divergence of between 5.6 and 10.5\%. The low level of nucleotide divergence among Indian HIV-1 and HIV-2 sequences suggests a fairly recent introduction of each virus into this population from a single point of entry in each case. The HIV-2 sequences reported here represent the first analysis of Asian HIV-2 strains and confirm the serological pattern previously detected in India. These data show that a substantial spread of HIV-2, together with HIV-1, has appeared outside Africa in a population hitherto unexposed to HIV. These findings imply that further spread of HIV-2 worldwide is to be expected and have important implications for future vaccine and therapy development.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8139000</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/68/4/2161</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To define the cellular immunological correlates of good prognosis in HIV-2 infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV Gag-specific T cell function in HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected Gambians. Using cytokine flow cytometry and lymphoproliferation assays, we show that HIV-specific CD4+ T cells from HIV-2-infected individuals maintained proliferative capacity, were not terminally differentiated (CD57−), and more frequently produced IFN-γ or IL-2 than CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected donors. Polyfunctional (IFN-γ+/IL-2+) HIV-specific CD4+ T cells were found exclusively in HIV-2+ donors. The disparity in CD4+ T cell responses between asymptomatic HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected subjects was not associated with differences in the proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. This study demonstrates that HIV-2-infected donors have a well-preserved and functionally heterogeneous HIV-specific memory CD4+ T cell response that is associated with delayed disease progression in the majority of infected people.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16709858</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jimmunol.org/content/176/11/6973</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We developed an internally controlled quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to measure HIV-2 viral load and determined levels of plasma virus in a cohort of registered commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. The assay has a lower limit of detection of 100 copies/mL and is linear over 4 logs. HIV-2 viral RNA was detectable in 56\% of all samples tested; the median load was 141 copies/mL. Levels of viral RNA in the plasma were inversely related to CD4+ cell counts. HIV-2 and HIV-1 viral loads were compared among the seroincident women in the cohort; the median viral load was 30X lower in the HIV-2-infected women (P\textless .001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), irrespective of the length of time infected.

Closely related viruses (SIVs) are found in many species of non-human primates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that cross-species transmission events have been quite frequent. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 appear to have resulted from multiple transfers of lentiviruses naturally infecting other primates; the source of HIV-2 appears to have been sooty mangabeys, whereas for HIV-1 the source may have been chimpanzees. Phylogenetic analyses also provide evidence that recombination has occurred between divergent viruses in vivo. Evolutionary trees based on various regions of the viral genome generally have consistent branching orders. However, some isolates fall into significantly different phylogenetic positions, indicating that their genomes are mosaics of sequences with different evolutionary histories. This implies that co-infection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates; this could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties, and also has important implications for HIV vaccine development programmes.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>ArticleType: research-article / Issue Title: New Uses for New Phylogenies / Full publication date: Jul. 29, 1995 / Copyright © 1995 The Royal Society</NOTES><URL>10.2307/56122</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jstor.org/stable/56122</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

A characteristic feature of this virus is its genomic heterogeneity, which occurs to varying degrees in different viral isolates. To define further the nature and extent of these genomic changes, we compared the molecularly cloned genomes of two variant HTLV-III isolates by extensive restriction enzyme mapping and heteroduplex thermal melt analysis. Both viral isolates were found to be highly related to each other throughout their entire genomic complement, yet they differed markedly in their restriction enzyme maps. Electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis revealed several distinct regions of divergence located almost exclusively in the part of the genome that encodes the viral envelope gene. In vitro culture of one of these viruses over a period of 3 months did not result in any genomic changes as determined by restriction analysis of viral DNA. These results, as well as the recently published nucleotide sequences of other HTLV-III isolates, indicate that the most substantial variation among HTLV-III isolates is located in the envelope. These findings raise the possibility that viral isolates from different individuals could have important biological differences in their envelope antigens, a consideration relevant to ongoing attempts to develop a vaccine against HTLV-III.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2991896 PMCID: PMC390995</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC390995/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The virus persists in the human host through active replication and is able to avoid clearance by the immune system. Active replication is an important component of the rapid evolutionary potential of HIV-1, a potential which manifests itself in the evolution of immune escape variants, drug resistant variants, and variants with the ability to use different cell surface coreceptors in conjunction with CD4. Multiple zoonotic introductions, compartmentalization of virus replication in the body, and genetic bottlenecks associated with sampling during transmission, antiretroviral therapy, and geographic and/or host population isolation further contribute to the range of sequences present in extant viruses. The sum of the history of all of these phenomena is reflected in HIV-1 sequence variability, and most of these phenomena are ongoing today. Here we review the use of HIV-1 sequence variability to explore its underlying biology.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00271-4</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170201002714</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To provide durable clinical benefit, emergence of drug resistance is countered by prescription of alternative drug regimens. Data on sequential treatments that are effective after virologic failure and the selection of drug resistance is largely confined to HIV-1 subtype B, the clade that has circulated in North America and Europe. However, HIV-1 subtype B currently accounts for only 12\% of the estimated 40 million HIV infected individuals worldwide. The global HIV-1 epidemic includes infection with nine identified HIV-1 group M subtypes (A–K), as well as distinct sub-subtypes and numerous chimerical or recombinant forms. Increasing access to treatment of HIV-1 in the developing world and increasing non-subtype B infection through travel and migration pose new questions about the susceptibility and response of these diverse HIV-1 viruses to antiretroviral drugs. Here we review HIV diversity and the published literature on drug resistance, comparing the known resistance mutations in individuals infected with subtype B to the growing experience in the treatment of non-subtype B HIV-1 worldwide.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S1386-6532(03)00115-X</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320300115X</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

One of these proteins, Vpx, is unique to the HIV-2/SIVsm lineage and is critical for viral replication in macrophages. The functional basis for this requirement, as well as the Vpx mode of action, has remained unexplained, and it is all the more enigmatic that HIV type 1 (HIV-1), which has no Vpx counterpart, can infect macrophages. Here, we underscore DCAF1 as a critical host effector of Vpx in its ability to mediate infection and long-term replication of HIV-2 in human macrophages. Vpx assembles with the CUL4A-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase through DCAF1 recruitment. Precluding Vpx present in the incoming virions from recruiting DCAF1 in target macrophages leads to a postentry block characterized by defective accumulation of HIV-2 reverse transcripts. In addition, Vpx from SIVsm functionally complements Vpx-defective HIV-2 in a DCAF1-binding-dependent manner. Altogether, our data point to a mechanism in which Vpx diverts the Cul4A-DDB1DCAF1 ligase to inactivate an evolutionarily conserved factor, which restricts macrophage infection by HIV-2 and closely related simian viruses.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19264781</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.00187-09</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/83/10/4854</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Three of these compounds showed the generally expected patterns of resistance and susceptibility with the various chimeric RTs. However, the inhibition patterns of the chimeric RTs by calanolide A provided evidence that there is a segment between residues 94 and 157 in HIV-1 RT that is critical for inhibition.

However, with the advent of new sequencing technologies, genomics research is now at the threshold of a second revolution. Several second-generation sequencing platforms became available in 2007, but a further revolution in DNA resequencing technologies is being witnessed in 2008, with the launch of the first single-molecule DNA sequencer (Helicos Biosciences), which has already been used to resequence the genome of the M13 virus. This review discusses several single-molecule sequencing technologies that are expected to become available during the next few years and explains how they might impact on genomics research.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.07.003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779908002047</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

This approach allows charged polymers (including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and RNA) to be analysed with subnanometre resolution and without the need for labels or amplification. Recent advances suggest that nanopore-based sensors could be competitive with other third-generation DNA sequencing technologies, and may be able to rapidly and reliably sequence the human genome for under \$1,000.

As a result, HIV-1 mutants that do not express the Vif protein are replication incompetent in 'nonpermissive' cells, such as primary T cells and the T-cell line CEM, that express APOBEC3G. In contrast, Vif-defective HIV-1 replicates effectively in 'permissive' cell lines, such as a derivative of CEM termed CEM-SS, that do not express APOBEC3G. Here, we show that a second human protein, APOBEC3F, is also specifically packaged into HIV-1 virions and inhibits their infectivity. APOBEC3F binds the HIV-1 Vif protein specifically and Vif suppresses both the inhibition of virus infectivity caused by APOBEC3F and virion incorporation of APOBEC3F. Surprisingly, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are extensively coexpressed in nonpermissive human cells, including primary lymphocytes and the cell line CEM, where they form heterodimers. In contrast, both genes are quiescent in the permissive CEM derivative CEM-SS. Together, these data argue that HIV-1 Vif has evolved to suppress at least two distinct but related human antiretroviral DNA-editing enzymes.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/sj.emboj.7600246</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/emboj/journal/v23/n12/full/7600246a.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The virus most closely related to HIV-1 is a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) thus far identified only in captive members of the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Here we report the detection of SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids in fecal samples from wild-living P. t. troglodytes apes in southern Cameroon, where prevalence rates in some communities reached 29 to 35\%. By sequence analysis of endemic SIVcpz strains, we could trace the origins of pandemic (group M) and nonpandemic (group N) HIV-1 to distinct, geographically isolated chimpanzee communities.

METHODS: A total of 152 HIV-positive patients followed at two hospitals in southern Brazil had their viral pol genes isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasma. PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed using HIV-1 subtype reference sequences. Six full-length subtype C viruses from Brazil previously described as 'pure' strains were included in the analysis. Sequences suggestive of recombination were analysed by boot scanning and phylogenetic analyses of separate fragments. The common ancestry of recombinant strains was evaluated by similarity plot and informative site analyses. RESULTS: : HIV-1 subtypes commonly found in Brazil (B, C and F1) were observed. Sixty-two viruses were initially assigned as subtype C, but 15 viruses clustered in a separate internal clade. Pol from two full-length genomes of subtype C viruses grouped together with those samples. Boot scanning analysis showed that all 17 viruses had the same recombinant structure, with a 240 base pair fragment of subtype B in the middle of the reverse transcriptase pol region. Subtype B assignment of this fragment was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using different methods of tree inference and cluster robustness tests. Mosaics were shown to have a common ancestry. CONCLUSION: As CRF\_BC represents 11\% of the HIV-1 viruses circulating in the southern region of the country, which borders several south American countries, the assessment of its spread is of pivotal importance to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil and Latin America.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17053347</NOTES><URL>10.1097/01.aids.0000247573.95880.db</URL></RECORD>

To generate full-length subtype C clones and sequences, we selected 13 primary (PBMC-derived) isolates from Zambia, India, Tanzania, South Africa, Brazil, and China, which were identified as subtype C by partial sequence analysis. Near full-length viral genomes were amplified by using a long PCR technique, sequenced in their entirety, and phylogenetically analyzed. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed 10.2, 6.3, and 17.3\% diversity in predicted Gag, Pol, and Env protein sequences. Ten of 13 viruses were nonmosaic subtype C genomes, while all three isolates from China represented B/C recombinants. One of them was composed primarily of subtype C sequences with three small subtype B portions in gag, pol, and nef genes. Two others exhibited these same mosaic regions, but contained two additional subtype B portions at the gag/pol overlap and in the accessory gene region, suggesting ongoing B/C recombination in China. All subtype C genomes contained a prematurely truncated second exon of rev, but other previously proposed subtype C signatures, including three potential NF-kappa B-binding sites in the viral promoter-enhancer regions, were found in only a subset of these genomes.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11177395</NOTES><URL>10.1089/08892220150217247</URL></RECORD>

A comprehensive and detailed description of HIV strains in the pandemic is an important foundation for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The current sequence database for HIV includes almost 800 complete genome sequences, documenting HIV-1 groups M, O, and N, and HIV-2. Among HIV-1 group M strains, responsible for the vast majority of HIV infections worldwide, 743 sequences represent 9 genetic subtypes, 16 circulating recombinant forms (CRF) that are spreading in populations, and a variety of unique recombinant forms (URF), identified so far only from a single individual. The global distribution of HIV is complex and dynamic with regional epidemics harboring only a subset of the global diversity. HIV strains differ enormously in terms of global prevalence. Six strains account for the majority of HIV infections: HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, and two of the CRF, CRF01-AE and CRF02\_AG, respectively. Many of the known subtypes and recombinant forms are currently rare in the epidemic, but could spread more widely if favorable conditions arise. HIV-2 is largely restricted to West Africa at relatively low prevalence there. Groups O and N of HIV-1 are very rare in the pandemic. The goal of universal coverage of HIV-1 strains by diagnostic tests can be met by minimizing false negative test rates for the six globally prevalent HIV-1 group M strains and HIV-2, and by evaluating systematically coverage of rare subtypes and recombinant forms.

A total of 247 HIV-1-positive samples, collected during an epidemiologic survey conducted in 1997 in three regions (Kinshasa [the capital], Bwamanda [in the north], and Mbuyi-Maya [in the south]), were genetically characterized in theenv V3-V5 region. All known subtypes were found to cocirculate, and for 6\% of the samples the subtype could not be identified. Subtype A is predominant, with prevalences decreasing from north to south (69\% in the north, 53\% in the capital city, and 46\% in the south). Subtype C, D, G, and H prevalences range from 7 to 9\%, whereas subtype F, J, K, and CRF01-AE strains represent 2 to 4\% of the samples; only one subtype B strain was identified. The highest prevalence (25\%) of subtype C was in the south, and CRF01-AE was seen mainly in the north. The high intersubtype variability among the V3-V5 sequences is the most probable reason for the low (45\%) efficiency of subtype A-specific PCR and HMA (heteroduplex mobility assay). Eighteen (29\%) of 62 samples had discordant subtype designations betweenenv and gag. Sequence analysis of the entire envelope from 13 samples confirmed the high degree of diversity and complexity of HIV-1 strains in the DRC; 9 had a complex recombinant structure in gp160, involving fragments of known and unknown subtypes. Interestingly, the unknown fragments from the different strains did not cluster together. Overall, the high number of HIV-1 subtypes cocirculating, the high intrasubtype diversity, and the high numbers of possible recombinant viruses as well as different unclassified strains are all in agreement with an old and mature epidemic in the DRC, suggesting that this region is the epicenter of HIV-1 group M.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11044094</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.74.22.10498-10507.2000</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/74/22/10498</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Perhaps the greatest challenge comes from the realization that HIV is not a single virus, but a group of related viruses. The remarkable genetic heterogeneity of HIV enables certain HIV strains to elude detection by some of our most widely used serologic assays, to develop resistance to antiviral compounds within weeks to months, and to escape from immune responses generated by natural infection and immunization. This article discusses the range of HIV genetic variation and possible reasons for this variation, and focuses on a specific subset of HIV–1 viruses known as group O.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0891-5520(05)70407-4</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891552005704074</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Depending on the genes studied, phylogenetic analysis showed that YBF30 branched either with SIVcpz-gab or between SIVcpz-gab and HIV-1 group M. The structural genes and tat, vpr, and nef of YBF30 are approximately equidistant from those of HIV-1 group M and SIVcpz-gab. In contrast, vif and rev are closer to HIV-1 group M, and vpu is highly divergent. Using a YBF30 V3 loop peptide enzyme immunoassay, we screened 700 HIV-1-positive sera collected in Cameroon; three reacted strongly with the YBF30 peptides and one was confirmed as being related to YBF30 by genetic analysis of a pol fragment. YBF30 is as distinct from SIVcpz-gab as it is from HIV-1 group M and can thus be considered as the prototype strain of a new human immunodeficiency virus group.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/2017</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nm/journal/v4/n9/full/nm0998_1032.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

While sequence motifs mediating this function have been determined by in vitro mutagenesis studies of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 molecular clones, it is unclear whether the highly variable Nef sequences of primary isolates in vivo rely on the same sequence motifs. To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically HIV-1-infected persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered MHC-I downregulatory function under Gag-specific CTL immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with MHC-I downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations (A84D, Y135F, and G140R) that ablated MHC-I downregulation and 3 (N52A, S169I, and V180E) that partially impaired MHC-I downregulation. Globally, the CTL pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked MHC-I downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that CTL pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for MHC-I downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 22553319</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.00878-12</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/86/13/7126</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The majority of research into antiretroviral agents and drug resistance has been performed on subtype B viruses, yet non-subtype B strains are responsible for 90\% of global infections. Although it seems that combination antiretroviral regimens are effective against all HIV-1 subtypes, there is emerging evidence of subtype differences in drug resistance, relevant to antiretroviral strategies in different parts of the world. For this purpose, extensive sampling of HIV genetic diversity, curation and analyses are required to inform antiretroviral strategies in different parts of the world.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.coviro.2012.08.006</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712001320</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

During a 9-year period in Dakar, Senegal, the seroincidence of both HIV types was measured in a cohort of commercial sex workers. Despite a higher incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV-2-infected women had a lower incidence of HIV-1 than did HIV-seronegative women, with a relative risk of 0.32 (P = 0.008).

A novel human retrovirus, distinct from LAV/HTLV-III, has now been isolated from two AIDS patients from West Africa. Partial characterization of this virus revealed that it has biological and morphological properties very similar to LAV but that it differs in some of its antigenic components. Although the core antigens may share some common epitopes, the West African AIDS retrovirus and LAV differ substantially in their envelope glycoproteins. The envelope antigen of the West African virus can be recognized by serum from a macaque with simian AIDS infected by the simian retrovirus termed STLV-IIImac, suggesting that the West African AIDS virus may be more closely related to this simian virus than to LAV. Hybridization experiments with LAV subgenomic probes further established that this new retrovirus, here referred to as LAV-II, is distantly related to LAV and distinct from STLV-IIImac.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2425430</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.2425430</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/233/4761/343</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Several of the viral proteins also differed in molecular weight from the corresponding HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteins. Partial chemical cleavage of the most highly conserved viral proteins resulted in patterns which differed from those of HIV-1 and HIV-2. Furthermore, nucleic acid hybridization experiments were capable of discriminating between the virus types. Sequence analysis of the viral U3 region revealed a unique enhancer organization not found in other immunodeficiency viruses.

Thus the X-ORF is proven to be a new retroviral gene. The p14 is present in SIVMne in molar amounts equivalent to those of the gag proteins. This is the first example of a retrovirus that contains a substantial quantity of a viral protein that is not a product of the gag, pro, pol, or env genes. SIV p14 and its homolog in HIV-2 may function as nucleic acid binding proteins since purified p14 binds to single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro. Antisera to the purified protein detected p14 in SIVMne, SIVmac, and a homologous protein (16 kilodaltons) in HIV-2 but did not react with HIV-1. Diagnostic procedures based on this novel protein will distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 3388031</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.3388031</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4862/199</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Recently, nucleotide sequence analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVMAC revealed the existence of still another open reading frame, termed X, which is highly conserved between these two viruses but absent from HIV-1. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that the X open reading frame represents a functional retroviral gene in both HIV-2 and SIVMAC and that it encodes a virion-associated protein of 14 and 12 kilodaltons, respectively. We also describe the production of recombinant TrpE/X fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and show that sera from some HIV-2-infected individuals specifically recognize these proteins.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 3136256</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/62/9/3501</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The evolutionary history of the simian immunodeficiency virussooty mangabey/HIV-2 lineage was reconstructed by using available database sequences with known sampling dates, and a timescale for this history was calculated by using maximum likelihood methods. The date of the most recent common ancestor of HIV-2 subtype A strains was estimated to be 1940 ± 16 and that of B strains was estimated to be 1945 ± 14. In addition we used coalescent theory to estimate the past population dynamics of HIV-2 subtype A in a rural population of Guinea-Bissau. Parametric and nonparametric estimates of the effective number of infections through time were obtained for an equal sample of gag, pol, and env sequences. Our estimates of the epidemic history of HIV-2 subtype A in Guinea-Bissau show a transition from constant size to rapid exponential growth around 1955–1970. Our analysis provides evidence for a zoonotic transfer of HIV-2 during the first half of the 20th century and an epidemic initiation in Guinea-Bissau that coincides with the independence war (1963–1974), suggesting that war-related changes in sociocultural patterns had a major impact on the HIV-2 epidemic.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12743376</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.0936469100</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/100/11/6588</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Using HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific enzyme immunoassays and confirmatory Western blot analysis to test for antibodies to SIVsm-related lentiviruses, we found only nine subjects (0.096\%) who tested positive for HIV: seven tested positive for HIV-1 and two tested positive for HIV-2. Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra Leone displayed the lowest seroprevalence (0.021\%) of HIV-2 infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported seroprevalence in SIVsm-infected feral and household pet sooty mangabeys. Heteroduplex analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found HIV-1 strains belonged to subtype A, the most common HIV-1 subtype in Africa, but this is the first report of subtype A in Sierra Leone. The two HIV-2-infected individuals harbored two distinct HIV-2 strains, designated 93SL1 and 93SL2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HIV-2 93SL1 is a member of HIV-2 subtype A, the first strain of this HIV-2 subtype found in Sierra Leone. In contrast, HIV-2 93SL2 belongs to none of the five previously characterized HIV-2 subtypes (A to E) but is a new subtype, herein designated F, having the most divergent transmembrane sequences yet reported for HIV-2. The fact that both of the two most divergent HIV-2 subtypes known, E and F, are rare and found as single occurrences in persons from Sierra Leone may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains free-living and household pet sooty mangabeys with highly divergent variants of SIVsm. This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new HIV-2 subtypes result from independent cross-species transmission of SIVsm to the human population and that these single-occurrence transmission events had not spread widely into the population by 1993.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9094672</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/71/5/3953</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

This report provides guidelines for when to initiate antiretroviral therapy, selection of appropriate initial regimens, patient monitoring, when to change therapy, and what regimens to use when changing.Data Sources and Study Selection  A panel with expertise in HIV research and clinical care reviewed relevant data published or presented at selected scientific conferences since the last panel report through April 2010. Data were identified through a PubMed search, review of scientific conference abstracts, and requests to antiretroviral drug manufacturers for updated clinical trials and adverse event data.Data Extraction and Synthesis  New evidence was reviewed by the panel. Recommendations were drafted by section writing committees and reviewed and edited by the entire panel. The quality and strength of the evidence were rated and recommendations were made by full panel consensus.Conclusions  Patient readiness for treatment should be confirmed before initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Therapy is recommended for asymptomatic patients with a CD4 cell count ≤500/μL, for all symptomatic patients, and those with specific conditions and comorbidities. Therapy should be considered for asymptomatic patients with CD4 cell count \textgreater500/μL. Components of the initial and subsequent regimens must be individualized, particularly in the context of concurrent conditions. Patients receiving antiretroviral treatment should be monitored regularly; treatment failure should be detected and managed early, with the goal of therapy, even in heavily pretreated patients, being HIV-1 RNA suppression below commercially available assay quantification limits.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1001/jama.2010.1004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2010.1004</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Episodic use involved the deferral of therapy until the CD4+ count decreased to less than 250 per cubic millimeter and then the use of therapy until the CD4+ count increased to more than 350 per cubic millimeter. The primary end point was the development of an opportunistic disease or death from any cause. An important secondary end point was major cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease.RESULTS:A total of 5472 participants (2720 assigned to drug conservation and 2752 to viral suppression) were followed for an average of 16 months before the protocol was modified for the drug conservation group. At baseline, the median and nadir CD4+ counts were 597 per cubic millimeter and 250 per cubic millimeter, respectively, and 71.7\% of participants had plasma HIV RNA levels of 400 copies or less per milliliter. Opportunistic disease or death from any cause occurred in 120 participants (3.3 events per 100 person-years) in the drug conservation group and 47 participants (1.3 per 100 person-years) in the viral suppression group (hazard ratio for the drug conservation group vs. the viral suppression group, 2.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 3.7; P\textless0.001). Hazard ratios for death from any cause and for major cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic disease were 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.9; P=0.007) and 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.5; P=0.009), respectively. Adjustment for the latest CD4+ count and HIV RNA level (as time-updated covariates) reduced the hazard ratio for the primary end point from 2.6 to 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.0 to 2.1).CONCLUSIONS:Episodic antiretroviral therapy guided by the CD4+ count, as used in our study, significantly increased the risk of opportunistic disease or death from any cause, as compared with continuous antiretroviral therapy, largely as a consequence of lowering the CD4+ cell count and increasing the viral load. Episodic antiretroviral therapy does not reduce the risk of adverse events that have been associated with antiretroviral therapy.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/6514/</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, attempts at purely electronic measurements have not achieved the signal contrast required for single nucleotide differentiation. In this report we propose a novel method of optical detection of DNA sequence translocating through a nanopore. Methods: Each base of the target DNA sequence is 1st mapped onto a 2-unit code, 2 10-bp nucleotide sequence, by biochemical conversion into Designed DNA Polymers. These 2-unit codes are then hybridized to complementary, fluorescently labeled, and self-quenching molecular beacons. As the molecular beacons are sequentially unzipped during translocation through a \textless2-nm-wide nanopore, their fluorescent tags are unquenched and are detected by a custom-built dual-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. The 2-color optical signal is then correlated to the target DNA sequence. Results: A dual-color TIRFM microscope with single-molecule resolution was constructed, and controlled fabrication of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays of solid-state nanopores was performed. A nanofluidic cell assembly was constructed for TIRF-based optical detection of voltage-driven DNA translocation through a nanopore. Conclusions: We present a novel nanopore-based DNA sequencing technique that uses an optical readout of DNA translocating unzipping through a nanopore. Our technique offers better single nucleotide differentiation in sequence readout, as well as the possibility of large-scale parallelism using nanopore arrays.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17890440</NOTES><URL>10.1373/clinchem.2007.091231</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.clinchem.org/content/53/11/1996</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Background. Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) point-of-care tests detect antibodies (Ab) but not p24 antigen (Ag) or RNA. In the absence of antibodies, p24 antigen and RNA typically indicate acute HIV infection. We conducted a field evaluation of the Determine® HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo rapid test (Combo RT). Methods. The antigen portion of the Combo RT (for acute HIV infection) was compared with a Roche Monitor HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction assay. The antibody portion of Combo RT (for established HIV infection) was compared with rapid test algorithms. Participants were enrolled at a sexually transmitted infection clinic and HIV testing and counseling center in Lilongwe, Malawi. Rapid testing was conducted with parallel testing in the clinic and serial testing in the center. The Combo RT was performed in clinic participants with negative or discordant antibody results and in all center participants. Results. Of the participants 838 were HIV negative, 163 had established HIV infection, and 8 had acute HIV infection. For detecting acute HIV infection, the antigen portion had a sensitivity of 0.000 and a specificity of 0.983. For detecting established HIV infection, the antibody portion had a sensitivity of 0.994 and a specificity of 0.992. Conclusions. Combo RT displayed excellent performance for detecting established HIV infection and poor performance for detecting acute HIV infection. In this setting, Combo RT is no more useful than current algorithms.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 22207651</NOTES><URL>10.1093/infdis/jir789</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/205/4/528</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Some observations suggested that virion-associated p24 is suboptimally detected using Triton X-100-based virus dissociation buffer (kit buffer). A new reagent (SNCR buffer) containing both denaturing and non-denaturing detergents was therefore developed and evaluated. The SNCR buffer increased the measured p24 concentration about 1.5- to 3-fold in HIV-negative plasma reconstituted with purified HIV-1 particles, while not increasing the background. Among 127 samples of HIV-1-positive patients with moderate to high concentrations of HIV-1 RNA the increase was about threefold across the entire concentration range (P \textless 0.0001). Specificity before neutralization among prospectively tested clinical samples ruled HIV-negative was 828 of 845 (98.0\%) for the SNCR buffer and 464 of 479 (96.9\%) for kit buffer. Specificity after confirmatory neutralization of reactive samples or a follow-up test was 100\% with either buffer. Surprisingly, the SNCR buffer revealed a p24 reactivity in 115 of 187 samples (61.5\%) from adult patients exhibiting undetectable HIV-1 RNA below 5 copies/ml for a duration of 6-30 months under HAART (3.7\% with kit buffer). The rate of p24 reactivity in these patients did not decrease with duration of HAART. In conclusion, the SNCR buffer improves the detection of particle-associated HIV-1 p24, thereby increasing the measured p24 concentration in samples with medium to high HIV-1 RNA. It also uncovers the presence of a p24 reactivity, whose identity remains to be determined, in a significant fraction of samples with undetectable HIV-1 RNA under long-term HAART.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16789014</NOTES><URL>10.1002/jmv.20655</URL></RECORD>

We conducted a prospective study to evaluate methods of detecting clients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) who were acutely coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods. After informed consent was obtained, all clients with acute STDs were offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing by 2 rapid antibody tests. Samples from rapid test-negative or -discordant subjects were pooled (50:5:1) and tested for HIV RNA. Western blots were performed on all rapid test-discordant specimens with detectable HIV RNA. A subset of specimens received p24 antigen testing with standard and/or ultrasensitive methods. Patients with possible acute HIV infection were followed to confirm seroconversion. Results. A total of 1450 clients (34\% female and 66\% male) agreed to testing, of whom 588 (40.55\%) had established HIV infection and 21 (1.45\%) had acute infection. Discordant rapid antibody tests identified 7 of 21 (33.3\% sensitivity), standard p24 antigen identified 12 of 16 (75\% sensitivity), and ultrasensitive p24 antigen identified 15 of 17 (88\% sensitivity) acute cases. By definition, the sensitivity of the RNA assay was 100\%. Conclusions. Real-time pooled RNA testing for the detection of acute HIV infection is feasible in resource-limited settings. However, parallel rapid testing and p24 antigen testing are technologically simpler and together may detect ∼90\% of acute cases.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17205481</NOTES><URL>10.1086/510755</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/195/3/416</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The International AIDS Society–USA sought to update prior recommendations to provide guidance for clinicians regarding indications for HIV-1 resistance testing.Participants  An International AIDS Society–USA 13-member physician panel with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and patient care involving HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs was reconvened to provide recommendations for the clinical use of drug resistance testing.Evidence and Consensus Process  The full panel met regularly between January and October 1999. Resistance and resistance testing data appearing in the last decade through April 2000 and presentations at national and international research conferences were reviewed. Recommendations and considerations were developed by 100\% group consensus, acknowledging that definitive data to support final recommendations are not yet available.Conclusions  Emerging data indicate that despite limitations, resistance testing should be incorporated into patient management in some settings. Resistance testing is recommended to help guide the choice of new regimens after treatment failure and for guiding therapy for pregnant women. It should be considered in treatment-naive patients with established infection, but cannot be firmly recommended in this setting.

The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in antiretroviral drug management, HIV-1 drug resistance, and patient care to provide updated recommendations for HIV-1 resistance testing. Published data and presentations at scientific conferences, as well as strength of the evidence, were considered. Properly used resistance testing can improve virological outcome among HIV-infected individuals. Resistance testing is recommended in cases of acute or recent HIV infection, for certain patients who have been infected as long as 2 years or more prior to initiating therapy, in cases of antiretroviral failure, and during pregnancy. Limitations of resistance testing remain, and more study is needed to refine optimal use and interpretation.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12830416</NOTES><URL>10.1086/375597</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/1/113</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

There was 1 mutation associated with protease inhibitor resistance in 1996-1997 (2.5\%) and there were 7 (7.7\%) in 2000-2001 (P = .25). Genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) initially decreased and then returned to prior levels (P = .007 for test of homogeneity). Genotypic resistance to 2 or more classes of drugs increased from 1 (2.5\%) to 12 (13.2\%) (P = .004), but only 1 infection (1.2\%) in the latter period was resistant to all 3 classes of agents (P = .58). Primary phenotypic resistance decreased for NRTIs from 21\% to 6.2\% (P = .03) and increased for NNRTIs from 0 to 8 (9.9\%) (P = .02). Phenotypic resistance increased for protease inhibitors from 2.6\% to 6.2\% (P = .32). Median time to virologic suppression (\textless500 copies/mL) during therapy was 12 weeks for patients with genotypic evidence of resistance compared with 5 weeks for patients with drug-sensitive infections (P = .02).Conclusions  The frequency of primary resistance to NNRTIs is increasing, although resistance to all available classes of antiretroviral therapy remains rare. Genotypic resistance testing in recently infected persons predicts time to viral suppression during therapy.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1001/jama.288.2.181</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.288.2.181</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Phenotypic analysis was performed with a recombinant virus assay.Setting and Patients  Eighty individuals referred, on average, 1.7 months after infection with HIV-1 to the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center between July 1995 and April 1999. Subjects were from large urban areas (65 from New York, NY; 11 from Los Angeles, Calif); 60 (75\%) were white, and 75 (93.8\%) were homosexual men.Main Outcome Measures  Prevalence of known resistance-conferring genotypes and reduced susceptibility to individual antiviral agents by phenotype.Results  Thirteen individuals (16.3\%) had genotypes associated with drug resistance to any antiretroviral agent. Virus with known resistance-conferring mutations to any nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was found in 10 individuals, to any nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 6 subjects, and to any protease inhibitors in 2 cases. Multidrug-resistant virus was identified in 3 individuals (3.8\%). Extensive polymorphism in the protease gene was identified. Interpretation of genotypes and phenotypes was concordant in 57 (85\%) of the 67 cases in which both studies were performed.Conclusion  The prevalence of HIV-1 variants with known resistance-conferring genotypes to any antiretroviral agent in this cohort of 80 newly infected individuals is 16.3\%. These data support expanded use of resistance testing in the setting of primary HIV-1 infection. Clinical trials should be initiated to establish whether therapy guided by resistance testing, compared with the use of empirical triple combination antiretroviral therapy, provides additional virological and immunological benefit when treating primary HIV-1 infection. Further efforts to expand the study of transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants, particularly in cohorts with different epidemiological profiles, are indicated.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1001/jama.282.12.1135</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.282.12.1135</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Although they belong to different and diverse chemical families, they share a common and unique mechanism of action: their interaction with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase induces conformational changes that inhibit the catalytic activities of the enzyme. They are characterized by their specificity for HIV-1, which makes them very selective inhibitors of the virus. First generation NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, have become a cornerstone for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Further research has led to the discovery and development of next generation NNRTIs with an increased genetic barrier to the development of resistance. Etravirine is the first NNRTI to show sustained virologic efficacy in patients with NNRTI resistant HIV-1. This review covers the NNRTI class of anti-HIV-1 drugs, from the initial discovery of the class in 1990 to the current compounds in clinical development, i.e. around 20 years of research and development efforts. It describes the characteristics of the NNRTIs, their mechanisms of action, HIV-1 resistance to the inhibitors, and the drugs that have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, or are currently in clinical development. The role of NNRTIs in prevention of HIV transmission is also addressed.

Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097 and DMP 266 (efavirenz)]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific `pocket' site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to `knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with NRTIs (AZT, 3TC, ddI or d4T) and/or PIs (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-HIV activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increased CD4 T-lymphocyte counts.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0166-3542(98)00025-4</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354298000254</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

DATA SOURCES: Articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE (May 2000-August 2009) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (May 1998-August 2009), using the key words etravirine, rilpivirine, TMC125, TMC278, diarylpyrimidine, NNRTI, and resistance. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical trials, resistance studies, and pharmacokinetic data were selected for review. DATA SYNTHESIS: NNRTIs are an integral class of antiretroviral agents utilized for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. These agents have become preferred therapy options for treatment-naïve individuals per treatment guideline recommendations and have gained increased popularity over protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral therapy. However, available NNRTIs possess inherent characteristics, such as low genetic barrier to resistance and high degree of cross-resistance, that limit their use in HIV therapy. Due to the growing utilization of this highly efficacious antiretroviral class and the increased capability for resistance development, many HIV-infected patients have experienced treatment failure of an NNRTI. Cross-resistance makes other first-generation NNRTI agents unavailable for future use. Etravirine and rilpivirine are second-generation NNRTIs that are not significantly hampered by cross-resistance and possess potent antiretroviral activity against current NNRTI-resistant viral strains. These agents provide new and important therapy options for many HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: NNRTI resistance is an increasing problem that may impair the chances for therapeutic success in HIV-infected patients. Novel agents such as etravirine and rilpivirine provide new, sensitive options for patients and significantly improve the rate of virologic suppression when appropriately applied.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19996323</NOTES><URL>10.1345/aph.1M359</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.theannals.com/content/44/1/157</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Compared with first-generation drugs such as nevirapine, efavirenz shows greater resilience to drug resistance mutations within HIV-1 RT. In order to understand the basis for this resilience at the molecular level and to help the design of further-improved anti-AIDS drugs, we have determined crystal structures of efavirenz and nevirapine with wild-type RT and the clinically important K103N mutant. Results: The relatively compact efavirenz molecule binds, as expected, within the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket of RT. There are significant rearrangements of the drug binding site within the mutant RT compared with the wild-type enzyme. These changes, which lead to the repositioning of the inhibitor, are not seen in the interaction with the first-generation drug nevirapine. Conclusions: The repositioning of efavirenz within the drug binding pocket of the mutant RT, together with conformational rearrangements in the protein, could represent a general mechanism whereby certain second-generation non-nucleoside inhibitors are able to reduce the effect of drug-resistance mutations on binding potency.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00513-X</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096921260000513X</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, the 51-kilodalton subunit of identical sequence has no such cleft because the four subdomains of the pol domain occupy completely different relative positions. Two of the four pol subdomains appear to be structurally related to subdomains of the Klenow fragment, including one containing the catalytic site. The subdomain that appears likely to bind the template strand at the pol active site has a different structure in the two polymerases.

However, patients receiving protease inhibitors develop a marked lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia. Using cultured human and rat hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice, we demonstrate that protease inhibitor treatment inhibits proteasomal degradation of nascent apolipoprotein B, the principal protein component of triglyceride and cholesterol-rich plasma lipoproteins. Unexpectedly, protease inhibitors also inhibited the secretion of apolipoprotein B. This was associated with inhibition of cholesteryl-ester synthesis and microsomal triglyceride transfer-protein activity. However, in the presence of oleic acid, which stimulates neutral-lipid biosynthesis, protease-inhibitor treatment increased secretion of apolipoprotein B-lipoproteins above controls. These findings suggest a molecular basis for protease-inhibitor−associated hyperlipidemia, a serious adverse effect of an otherwise efficacious treatment for HIV infection.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nm1201-1327</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nm/journal/v7/n12/abs/nm1201-1327.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Potential microbicide candidates must be both safe and effective. Using cellular and tissue explant models, we have evaluated the activity of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) dapivirine as a vaginal microbicide. In tissue compatibility studies, dapivirine was well tolerated by epithelial cells, T cells, macrophages, and cervical tissue explants. Dapivirine demonstrated potent dose-dependent inhibitory effects against a broad panel of HIV type 1 isolates from different clades. Furthermore, dapivirine demonstrated potent activity against a wide range of NNRTI-resistant isolates. In human cervical explant cultures, dapivirine was able not only to inhibit direct infection of mucosal tissue but also to prevent the dissemination of the virus by migratory cells. Activity was retained in the presence of semen or a cervical mucus simulant. Furthermore, dapivirine demonstrated prolonged inhibitory effects: it was able to prevent both localized and disseminated infection for as long as 6 days posttreatment. The prolonged protection observed following pretreatment of genital tissue and the lack of observable toxicity suggest that dapivirine has considerable promise as a potential microbicide candidate.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19029331</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.01156-08</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/53/2/487</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In the absence of an effective vaccine, drugs are the only useful treatment. Anti-HIV drugs work; so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life. Unfortunately, HIV-1 develops resistance to all of the available drugs. Although a number of useful anti-HIV drugs have been approved for use in patients, the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process. The three viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) are all good drug targets. Two distinct types of RT inhibitors, both of which block the polymerase activity of RT, have been approved to treat HIV-1 infections, nucleoside analogs (NRTIs) and nonnucleosides (NNRTIs), and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the RNase H activity or block the polymerase in other ways. A better understanding of the structure and function(s) of RT and of the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs; in particular, drugs that are effective against the current drug-resistant strains of HIV-1.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.071</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283608013442</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Based on our previously described dynamic copy-choice mechanism for retroviral recombination and our observations that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) increase the frequency of reverse transcriptase template switching, we propose that an equilibrium exists between (i) NRTI incorporation, NRTI excision, and resumption of DNA synthesis and (ii) degradation of the RNA template by RNase H activity, leading to dissociation of the template-primer and abrogation of HIV-1 replication. As predicted by this model, mutations in the RNase H domain that reduced the rate of RNA degradation conferred high-level resistance to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine and 2,3-didehydro-2,3-dideoxythymidine by as much as 180- and 10-fold, respectively, by increasing the time available for excision of incorporated NRTIs from terminated primers. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which NRTIs inhibit HIV-1 replication and imply that mutations in RNase H could significantly contribute to drug resistance either alone or in combination with NRTI-resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15684061</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.0409823102</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/102/6/2093</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Structural determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) that influence its template-switching frequency are not known. To identify determinants of HIV-1 RT that affect the frequency of template switching, we developed an in vivo assay in which RT template-switching events during viral replication resulted in functional reconstitution of the green fluorescent protein gene. A survey of single amino acid substitutions near the polymerase active site or deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding site of HIV-1 RT indicated that several substitutions increased the rate of RT template switching. Several mutations associated with resistance to antiviral nucleoside analogs (K65R, L74V, E89G, Q151N, and M184I) dramatically increased RT template-switching frequencies by two- to sixfold in a single replication cycle. In contrast, substitutions in the RNase H domain (H539N, D549N) decreased the frequency of RT template switching by twofold. Depletion of intracellular nucleotide pools by hydroxyurea treatment of cells used as targets for infection resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the frequency of RT template switching. These results indicate that the dynamic steady state between polymerase and RNase H activities is an important determinant of HIV-1 RT template switching and establish that HIV-1 recombination occurs by the previously described dynamic copy choice mechanism. These results also indicate that mutations conferring resistance to antiviral drugs can increase the frequency of RT template switching and may influence the rate of retroviral recombination and viral evolution.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15280484</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.78.16.8761-8770.2004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/78/16/8761</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We quantified the effect of mutations in the YXDD motif, the deoxynucleoside triphosphate binding site, the thumb domain, and the RNase H domain of RT and hydroxyurea treatment on the frequencies of template switching.

We compared wild-type RT with the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q, D67N/K70R, and T215F/K219Q mutant enzymes. The D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant showed increased DNA polymerase processivity; this resulted from decreased template/primer dissociation from RT, and was due to the T215F/K219Q mutations. The D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant was less sensitive to AZTTP (IC50 approximately 300 nM) than wt RT (IC50 approximately 100 nM) in the presence of 0.5 mM pyrophosphate. This change in pyrophosphate-mediated sensitivity of the mutant enzyme was selective for AZTTP, since similar Km values for TTP and inhibition by ddCTP and ddGTP were noted with wt and mutant RT in the absence or in the presence of pyrophosphate. The D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant showed an increased rate of pyrophosphorolysis (the reverse reaction of DNA synthesis) of chain-terminated DNA; this enhanced pyrophosphorolysis was due to the D67N/K70R mutations. However, the processivity of pyrophosphorolysis was similar for the wild-type and mutant enzymes. We propose that HIV-1 resistance to AZT results from the selectively decreased binding of AZTTP and the increased pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of chain-terminated viral DNA by the mutant RT at physiological pyrophosphate levels, resulting in a net decrease in chain termination. The increased processivity of viral DNA synthesis may be important to enable facile HIV replication in the presence of AZT, by compensating for the increased reverse reaction rate.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9843396</NOTES><URL>10.1021/bi981200e</URL></RECORD>

Currently, two classes of RT inhibitors are used clinically. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been used clinically in the treatment of HIV‐1 infection. This chapter describes the current clinically used RT inhibitors, outlining mechanisms of action as well as factors in HIV resistance to these drugs. In addition, some promising new pipeline RT inhibitors are discussed, including compounds directed at novel RT targets not addressed by current RT therapeutics, such as inhibitors of RT ribonuclease H (RNH) activity. There are a number of new NRTIs and NNRTIs, with improved resistance profiles, in late stage clinical development, and there are many others in preclinical development.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054358907560059</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Nevirapine, O-TIBO, and CI-TIBO each bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme-DNA complex close to the active site catalytic residues. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was used to establish the mechanism of inhibition by these noncompetitive inhibitors. Analysis of the pre-steady-state burst of DNA polymerization indicated that inhibitors blocked the chemical reaction, but did not interfere with nucleotide binding or the nucleotide-induced conformational change. Rather, in the presence of saturating concentrations of the inhibitors, the nucleoside triphosphate bound tightly (Kd, 100 nM), but nonproductively. The data suggest that an inhibitor combining the functionalities of a nonnucleoside inhibitor and a nucleotide analog could bind very tightly and specifically to reverse transcriptase and could be effective in the treatment of AIDS.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7532321</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.7532321</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/267/5200/988</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells. HIV-1 entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding,. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, CD4 and a neutralizing antibody. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions. Understanding the structural basis for the ability of HIV-1 to evade the humoral immune response should assist in the design of a vaccine.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/31514</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v393/n6686/full/393705a0.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The role of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease in the viral replication cycle was examined by use of a site-directed mutation in the protease gene. The HIV protease gene product was expressed in Escherichia coli and observed to cleave HIV gag p55 to gag p24 and gag p17 in vitro. Substitution of aspartic acid residue 25 (Asp-25) of this protein with an asparagine residue did not affect the expression of the protein, but it eliminated detectable in vitro proteolytic activity against HIV gag p55. A mutant HIV provirus was constructed that contained the Asn-25 mutation within the protease gene. SW480 human colon carcinoma cells transfected with the Asn-25 mutant proviral DNA produced virions that contained gag p55 but not gag p24, whereas virions from cells transfected with the wild-type DNA contained both gag p55 and gag p24. The mutant virions were not able to infect MT-4 lymphoid cells. In contrast, these cells were highly sensitive to infection by the wild-type virions. These results demonstrate that the HIV protease is an essential viral enzyme and, consequently, an attractive target for anti-HIV drugs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 3290901</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/85/13/4686</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Detailed knowledge of the structure of HIV protease and its substrate has led to the design of specific HIV protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance to all protease inhibitors (PIs) has been observed and the genetic basis of resistance has been well documented over the past 15 years. The arrival of the early PIs was a pivotal moment in the development of antiretroviral therapy. They made possible the dual class triple combination therapy that became known as HAART. However, the clinical utility of the first generation of PIs was limited by low bioavailability and high pill burdens, which ultimately reduced adherence and limited long-term viral inhibition. When therapy failure occurred multiple protease resistance mutations were observed, often resulting in broad class resistance. To combat PI-resistance development, second-generation approaches have been developed. The first advance was to increase the level of existing PIs in the plasma by boosting with ritonavir. The second was to develop novel PIs with high potency against the known PI-resistant HIV protease variants. Both approaches increased the number of protease mutations required for clinical resistance, thereby raising the genetic barrier. This review provides an overview of the history of protease inhibitor therapy, its current status and future perspectives. It forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, vol. 85, issue 1, 2010.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.10.003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209004902</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

This inhibitor is effective even when added to cultures at a late stage of infection, after syncytia have started to form. Virus antigen, virus particles and virus cytopathic effects can largely be cleared from cultures treated with compound from 3 days until 6 days post infection. In chronically-infected cells, inhibition of virus maturation can be detected after 24 hours' treatment with 10 nM Ro 31-8959. In addition, a significant reduction of the proteolytic processing of p56 to p24 can be demonstrated in these cells with compound at picomolar concentrations.

By using the X-ray crystal structure of the complex of HIV protease and ritonavir, the potent protease inhibitor ABT-378, which has a diminished interaction with Val 82, was designed. ABT-378 potently inhibited wild-type and mutant HIV protease (Ki = 1.3 to 3.6 pM), blocked the replication of laboratory and clinical strains of HIV type 1 (50\% effective concentration [EC50], 0.006 to 0.017 μM), and maintained high potency against mutant HIV selected by ritonavir in vivo (EC50, ≤0.06 μM). The metabolism of ABT-378 was strongly inhibited by ritonavir in vitro. Consequently, following concomitant oral administration of ABT-378 and ritonavir, the concentrations of ABT-378 in rat, dog, and monkey plasma exceeded the in vitro antiviral EC50 in the presence of human serum by \textgreater50-fold after 8 h. In healthy human volunteers, coadministration of a single 400-mg dose of ABT-378 with 50 mg of ritonavir enhanced the area under the concentration curve of ABT-378 in plasma by 77-fold over that observed after dosing with ABT-378 alone, and mean concentrations of ABT-378 exceeded the EC50 for \textgreater24 h.

UIC-94017 blocked the infectivity and replication of each of HIV-1NL4-3 variants exposed to and selected for resistance to saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, or ritonavir at concentrations up to 5 μM (IC50s, 0.003 to 0.029 μM), although it was less active against HIV-1NL4-3 variants selected for resistance to amprenavir (IC50, 0.22 μM). UIC-94017 was also potent against multi-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants isolated from patients who had no response to existing antiviral regimens after having received a variety of antiviral agents. Structural analyses revealed that the close contact of UIC-94017 with the main chains of the protease active-site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) is important for its potency and wide spectrum of activity against multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 variants. Considering the favorable pharmacokinetics of UIC-94017 when administered with ritonavir, the present data warrant that UIC-94017 be further developed as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of primary and multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 infections.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14506019</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.47.10.3123-3129.2003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/47/10/3123</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Virus populations with greater than 100-fold-increased resistance to both inhibitors compared with the parental virus have been obtained. DNA sequence analyses of the protease genes from VB-11,328- and VX-478-resistant variants reveal a sequential accumulation of point mutations, with similar resistance patterns occurring for the two inhibitors. The deduced amino acid substitutions in the resistant protease are Leu-10-\textgreaterPhe, Met-46-\textgreaterIle, Ile-47-\textgreaterVal, and Ile-50-\textgreaterVal. This is the first observation in HIV protease resistance studies of an Ile-50-\textgreaterVal mutation, a mutation that appears to arise uniquely against the sulfonamide inhibitor class. When the substitutions observed were introduced as single mutations into an HIV-1 infectious clone (HXB2), only the Ile-50-\textgreaterVal mutant showed reduced sensitivity (two- to threefold) to VB-11,328 and VX-478. A triple protease mutant infectious clone carrying the mutations Met-46-\textgreaterIle, Ile-47-\textgreaterVal, and Ile-50-\textgreaterVal, however, showed much greater reduction in sensitivity (14- to 20-fold) to VB-11,328 and VX-478. The same mutations were studied in recombinant HIV protease. The mutant protease Ile-50-\textgreaterVal displays a much lower affinity for the inhibitors than the parent enzyme (\textless or = 80-fold). The protease triply mutated at Met-46-\textgreaterIle, Ile-47-\textgreaterVal, and Ile-50-\textgreaterVal shows an even greater decrease in inhibitor binding (\textless or = 270-fold). The sulfonamide-resistant HIV protease variants remain sensitive to inhibitors from other chemical classes (Ro 31-8959 and L-735,524), suggesting possibilities for clinical use of HIV protease inhibitors in combination or serially.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7636964</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/69/9/5228</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Proof-of-principle studies indicate that BMS-232632 blocks the cleavage of viral precursor proteins in HIV-infected cells, proving that it functions as an HIV Prt inhibitor. Comparative studies showed that BMS-232632 is generally more potent than the five currently approved HIV-1 Prt inhibitors. Furthermore, BMS-232632 is highly selective for HIV-1 Prt and exhibits cytotoxicity only at concentrations 6,500- to 23,000-fold higher than that required for anti-HIV activity. To assess the potential of this inhibitor when used in combination with other antiretrovirals, BMS-232632 was evaluated for anti-HIV activity in two-drug combination studies. Combinations of BMS-232632 with either stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, or amprenavir in HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells yielded additive to moderately synergistic antiviral effects. Importantly, combinations of drug pairs did not result in antagonistic anti-HIV activity or enhanced cytotoxic effects at the highest concentrations used for antiviral evaluation. Our results suggest that BMS-232632 may be an effective HIV-1 inhibitor that may be utilized in a variety of different drug combinations.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10898681</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.44.8.2093-2099.2000</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/44/8/2093</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

L-735,524 represents a class of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitors, termed hydroxyaminopentane amides, that incorporate a basic amine into the hydroxyethylene inhibitor backbone. L-735,524 is a potent inhibitor of virus replication in cell culture and inhibits the protease-mediated cleavage of the viral precursor polyproteins that results in the production of noninfectious progeny viral particles. The compound is effective against viruses resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and is synergistically active when used in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Most importantly, L-735,524 exhibits good oral bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetic profiles in two species of laboratory animals by using clinically acceptable formulations. Accordingly, the compound was selected for evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetic studies in humans.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8171040</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/91/9/4096</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, although initially successful, a broader clinical experience has revealed limitations in this therapeutic regimen, with up to 40\% of treated individuals ultimately failing to sustain control over viral replication. Significant advances in understanding the process by which HIV-1 enters host cells have brought into clear focus a target for drug discovery not represented in the current clinical armamentarium. In this article, the mechanism of HIV-1 entry is reviewed in the context of representative antiviral agents that interfere with key steps in this process.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S1359-6446(00)01484-7</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644600014847</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The advantages offered by ritonavir boosting are primarily attributable to the drug’s pharmacokinetic properties. Ritonavir’s inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 enzyme reduces the metabolism of concomitantly administered protease inhibitors and changes their pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin) and half-life (t1/2). As a result, the bioavailability of the boosted protease inhibitor is increased and improved penetration into HIV reservoirs may be achieved. Boosted protease inhibitor regimens that utilize a low dose of ritonavir (100–200 mg) appear to offer the best balance of efficacy and tolerability. At this dose, ritonavir boosts the bioavailability of the second protease inhibitor without contributing significantly to the side effect profile of the regimen. In clinical trials, regimens boosted with low dose ritonavir have demonstrated high levels of viral suppression in both antiretroviral naïve patients and patients who previously failed antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitor therapy. Side effects observed have generally been similar to those associated with the boosted protease inhibitor. Based upon their enhanced drug exposure and demonstrated efficacy, the boosted ritonavir regimens should be among the first options considered for use in clinical practice.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14657084</NOTES><URL>10.1093/jac/dkh029</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/4</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The aim of therapy is complete virological suppression, with a current goal of \textless50 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA, in order to minimize the occurrence of drug resistance. Improved understanding of the pharmacology of PIs, primarily the importance of adequate drug exposure, has led to the widespread administration of PIs combined with a low ‘boosting’ dose of ritonavir. The combination of PIs with ritonavir can improve treatment responses in both treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Boosted PIs are an important therapeutic option for HIV and extensive data exist supporting their use. Use of individual agents should be guided by a resistance test at all stages of treatment from naive through to highly treatment-experienced patients. Currently, seven boosted PIs have both US and European licensing approval: indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, tipranavir and darunavir (formerly TMC114). The preferred first-line option in the USA is lopinavir. Many of the older PIs are less effective and/or have less favourable tolerability profiles. Emergent PI resistance is a major challenge in treatment, and it can be accelerated by partial suppression of viral load through inappropriate therapy combinations. Using the newer boosted PIs, which have more robust resistance profiles, with an optimized background regimen may increase the likelihood of complete viral suppression. This review discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of boosted PIs in current practice.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17890281</NOTES><URL>10.1093/jac/dkm364</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/6/1195</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In this study, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of a double boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen in this setting.MethodsA total of 64 HIV-infected patients who had failed NNRTI-based regimens were randomized to receive either lopinavir/saquinavir/ritonavir [LPV/SQV/r; 400/1000/100 mg twice a day (bid)] alone or indinavir/ritonavir (IDV/r; 800/100 mg bid) plus two NRTIs optimized with genotypic drug resistance guidance. Patients who had no available optimized NRTI backbone were allocated to the LPV/SQV/r arm.ResultsAt 48 weeks, the percentages of patients with plasma viral load\textless50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were 60\% (31 of 52 patients) in the LPV/SQV/r arm vs 50\% (six of 12) in the IDV/r/2NRTIs arm in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and 61\% (31 of 51) vs 71\% (five of seven), respectively, in the as-treated analysis. The median (interquartile range) increases in absolute CD4 cell count from baseline were 177 (91–269) and 100 (52–225) cells/μL in the LPV/SQV/r and IDV/r/2NRTIs groups, respectively (P=0.32). Four of 12 patients (33\%) in the IDV/r/2NRTIs group experienced severe nausea and vomiting and four patients (8\%) in the LPV/SQV/r group had significant hepatitis.ConclusionsLPV/SQV/r and high-dose boosted IDV were not well tolerated and led to \textless65\% ITT virological efficacy outcomes.

We compared the probability of attaining an undetectable HIV RNA level after using either boosted double or boosted single PI regimens. Design: Retrospective clinical cohort. Methods: PI-experienced subjects in a Northern California-based database who initiated either a boosted single or boosted double PI salvage therapy regimen were analysed. Traditional multivariable regression and marginal structural model analyses were used to compare the effects of the two regimens on virologic suppression 12–36 weeks after initiation of salvage therapy, controlling for confounding by baseline HIV RNA level, CD4 lymphocyte count, treatment history, drug resistance, and multiple characteristics of the salvage regimen. Results: Fifty-one percent of boosted single PI regimens (n=805) and 51.6\% of boosted double PI regimens (n=183) achieved a plasma HIV RNA level of \textless75\textgreatercopies/ml at week 12–36. In models including multiple potentially confounding variables, estimates of the relative odds of suppression on boosted double versus boosted single PI regimens ranged from 1.17 (95\% CI, 0.54–2.55) to 1.33 (95\% CI, 0.82–2.14). Conclusions: We were not able to reject the null hypothesis that boosted double versus boosted single PI regimens, resulted in equivalent probabilities of virologic success.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://works.bepress.com/maya_petersen/42</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Principal Findings Here, UDPS was used to analyze the dynamics of HIV-1 genetic variation in reverse transcriptase (RT) (amino acids 180–220) in six individuals consecutively sampled before, during and after failing 3TC and AZT containing antiretroviral treatment. Optimized UDPS protocols and bioinformatic software were developed to generate, clean and analyze the data. The data cleaning strategy reduced the error rate of UDPS to an average of 0.05\%, which is lower than previously reported. Consequently, the cut-off for detection of resistance mutations was very low. A median of 16,016 (range 2,406–35,401) sequence reads were obtained per sample, which allowed detection and quantification of minority resistance mutations at amino acid position 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215 and 219 in RT. In four of five pre-treatment samples low levels (0.07–0.09\%) of the M184I mutation were observed. Other resistance mutations, except T215A and T215I were below the detection limit. During treatment failure, M184V replaced M184I and dominated the population in combination with T215Y, while wild-type variants were rarely detected. Resistant virus disappeared rapidly after treatment interruption and was undetectable as early as after 3 months. In most patients, drug resistant variants were replaced by wild-type variants identical to those present before treatment, suggesting rebound from latent reservoirs. Conclusions With this highly sensitive UDPS protocol preexisting drug resistance was infrequently observed; only M184I, T215A and T215I were detected at very low levels. Similarly, drug resistant variants in plasma quickly decreased to undetectable levels after treatment interruption. The study gives important insights into the dynamics of the HIV-1 quasispecies and is of relevance for future research and clinical use of the UDPS technology.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pone.0011345</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011345</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Integration requires two metal-dependent reactions, 3′ end processing and strand transfer. Compounds that contain a diketo acid moiety have been shown to selectively inhibit the strand transfer reaction of IN in vitro and in infected cells and are effective as inhibitors of HIV-1 replication. To characterize the molecular basis of inhibition, we used functional assays and binding assays to evaluate a series of structurally related analogs. These studies focused on investigating the role of the conserved carboxylate and metal binding. We demonstrate that an acidic moiety such as a carboxylate or isosteric heterocycle is not required for binding to the enzyme complex but is essential for inhibition and confers distinct metal-dependent properties on the inhibitor. Binding requires divalent metal and resistance is metal dependent with active site mutants displaying resistance only when the enzymes are evaluated in the context of Mg2+. The mechanism of action of these inhibitors is therefore likely a consequence of the interaction between the acid moiety and metal ion(s) in the IN active site, resulting in a functional sequestration of the critical metal cofactor(s). These studies thus have implications for modeling active site inhibitors of IN, designing and evaluating analogs with improved efficacy, and identifying inhibitors of other metal-dependent phosphotransferases.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11997448</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.092056199</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/99/10/6661</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The purified protein, free of detectable contaminating endonucleases, selectively cleaved double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that mimic the U3 and the U5 termini of linear HIV DNA. Two nucleotides were removed from the 3' ends of both the U5 plus strand and the U3 minus strand; in both cases, cleavage was adjacent to a conserved CA dinucleotide. The reaction was metal-ion dependent, with a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. Reaction selectivity was further demonstrated by the lack of cleavage of an HIV U5 substrate on the complementary (minus) strand, an analogous substrate that mimics the U3 terminus of an avian retrovirus, and an HIV U5 substrate in which the conserved CA dinucleotide was replaced with a TA dinucleotide. Such an integration protein-mediated cleavage reaction is expected to occur as part of the integration event in the retroviral life cycle, in which a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA genome is inserted into the host cell DNA.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2164223</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/87/13/5119</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Efficient cleavage was restricted to HIV-1 substrates and did not occur with substrates derived from other retroviruses. Mutagenesis of the U5 long terminal repeat (LTR) terminus revealed only moderate effects of mutations outside the terminal four bases of the U5 LTR and highlighted the critical nature of the conserved CA dinucleotide motif shared by all retroviral termini. Integration of the endonuclease cleavage products occurs subsequent to cleavage, and evidence that the cleavage and integration reactions may be uncoupled is presented. Competition cleavage reactions demonstrated that IN-mediated processing of an LTR substrate could be inhibited by competition with LTR and non-LTR oligonucleotides.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1895409</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/65/10/5624</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here we present a simple in vitro system that carries out the integration reaction and the use of this system to probe the mechanism of integration. The only HIV protein necessary is the integration (IN) protein, which has been overexpressed in insect cells and then partially purified. DNA substrates are supplied as oligonucleotides that match the termini of the linear DNA product of reverse transcription. In the presence of HIV IN protein, oligonucleotide substrates are cleaved to generate the recessed 3' ends that are the precursor for integration, and the cleaved molecules are efficiently inserted into a DNA target. Analysis of reaction products reveals that HIV IN protein joins 3' ends of the viral DNA to 5' ends of cuts made by IN protein in the DNA target. We have also used this assay to characterize the sequences at the ends of the viral DNA involved in integration. The assay provides a simple screen for testing candidate inhibitors of HIV IN protein; some such inhibitors might have useful antiviral activity.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1847518</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.88.4.1339</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/88/4/1339</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Results: We have now identified a series of 5H-pyrano[2,3-d:-6,5-d′]dipyrimidines that block the replication of various strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. The most potent congener, 5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2,8-dithiol-4,6-dihydroxy-5H-pyrano[2,3-d:-6,5-d′]dipyrimidine (V-165), inhibited the replication of HIV-1(IIIB) in MT-4 cells at a 50\% effective concentration (EC50) of 8.9 μM, which is 14-fold below its cytotoxic concentration. V-165 was equally active against virus strains that were resistant toward inhibitors of viral entry or reverse transcriptase. In combination regimens in cell culture, V-165 acted subsynergistically with zidovudine or nelfinavir and synergistically with nevirapine. V-165 inhibited both reverse transcriptase and integrase activities in enzymatic assays at micromolar concentrations, but only a close correlation was found between the anti-HIV activity observed in cell culture and the inhibitory activity in the integrase strand transfer assays. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that V-165 interfered with the viral replication cycle at a time point coinciding with integration. Quantitative Alu-PCR corroborated that the anti-HIV activity of V-165 is based upon the inhibition of proviral DNA integration. Conclusions: Based on their mode of action, which is different from that of clinically approved anti-HIV drugs, PDPs are good candidates for further development into new drugs and to be included in future combination regimens.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0960-9822(02)00952-1</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982202009521</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To explore the mechanism of action of these inhibitors, various novel styrylquinoline derivatives were synthesized and tested against HIV-1 IN and in cell-based assays. Regarding the in vitro experiments, the structural requirements for biological activity are a carboxyl group at C-7, a hydroxyl group at C-8 in the quinoline subunit, and an ancillary phenyl ring. However the in vitro inhibitory profile tolerates deep alterations of this ring, e.g. by the introduction of various substituents or its replacement by heteroatomic nuclei. Regarding the ex vivo assays, the structural requirements for activity are more stringent than for in vitro inhibition. Thus, in addition to an o-hydroxy acid group in the quinoline, the presence of one ortho pair of substituents at C-3? and C-4?, particularly two hydroxyl groups, in the ancillary phenyl ring is imperatively required for inhibitory potency. Starting from literature data and the SARs developed in this work, a putative binding mode of styrylquinoline inhibitors to HIV-1 IN was derived.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1021/jm990467o</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm990467o</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Structure?activity studies reveal that the compounds possessing the pentatomic moiety SC(O)CNC(O) with two carbonyl groups are in general more potent against purified IN than those containing only one carbonyl group. Substitution with electron-donating or -withdrawing groups did not enhance nor abolish potency against purified IN. By contrast, compounds with a naphthalene ring system showed enhanced potency, suggesting that a hydrophobic pocket in the IN active site might accommodate an aromatic system rather than a halogen. The position of sulfur in the thiazole ring appears important for potency against IN, as its replacement with an oxygen or carbon abolished activity. Further extension of the thiazole ring diminished potency. Compounds 1, 19, and 20 showed antiviral activity and inhibited IN within similar concentrations. These compounds inhibited IN when Mn2+ or Mg2+ was used as cofactor. None of these compounds showed detectable activities against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, protease, virus attachment, or nucleocapsid protein zinc fingers. Therefore, thiazolothiazepines are potentially important lead compounds for development as inhibitors of IN and HIV replication.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1021/jm990047z</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm990047z</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Authors of all studies were contacted for detailed laboratory, ART, and adherence data.Study Selection and Data Abstraction  Studies involving ART-naive participants initiating NNRTI-based regimens were included. Participants were included if all drugs in their ART regimen were fully active by standard HIV drug resistance testing. Cox proportional hazard models using pooled patient-level data were used to estimate the risk of virologic failure based on a Prentice weighted case-cohort analysis stratified by study.Data Synthesis  Individual data from 10 studies and 985 participants were available for the primary analysis. Low-frequency drug resistance mutations were detected in 187 participants, including 117 of 808 patients in the cohort studies. Low-frequency HIV-1 drug resistance mutations were associated with an increased risk of virologic failure (hazard ratio (HR], 2.3 [95\% confidence interval \CI\, 1.7-3.3]; P \textless .001) after controlling for medication adherence, race/ethnicity, baseline CD4 cell count, and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Increased risk of virologic failure was most strongly associated with minority variants resistant to NNRTIs (HR, 2.6 [95\% CI, 1.9-3.5]; P \textless .001). Among participants from the cohort studies, 35\% of those with detectable minority variants experienced virologic failure compared with 15\% of those without minority variants.

Several compounds which block the attachment of HIV gp120 to either the CD4 T cell receptor or the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptors are currently in clinical development. Most of these compounds have different molecular structures and specific mechanisms of action. These agents are eagerly awaited by a growing number of patients carrying viruses resistant viruses to many of the current available reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. For enfuvirtide, the first and, so far, only entry inhibitor approved for clinical use, the main mechanism of resistance is the selection of changes within a 10 amino acid segment encompassing residues 36–45 within the HR1 region of gp41. For other entry inhibitors, multiple changes in different gp120 domains (V1, V2, V3, C2 and C4) have been associated with loss of susceptibility to these agents, although in most cases with limited cross-resistance.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16464888</NOTES><URL>10.1093/jac/dkl027</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/4/619</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

BMS-806 and \#155 block conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins that are induced by binding to the host cell receptor, CD4. We tested a panel of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein mutants and identified several that were resistant to the antiviral effects of BMS-806 and \#155. In the CD4-bound conformation of gp120, the amino acid residues implicated in BMS-806 and \#155 resistance line the “phenylalanine 43 cavity” and a water-filled channel that extends from this cavity to the inner domain. Structural considerations suggest a model in which BMS-806 and \#155 bind gp120 prior to receptor binding and, upon CD4 binding, are accommodated in the Phe-43 cavity and adjacent channel. The integrity of the nearby V1/V2 variable loops and N-linked carbohydrates on the V1/V2 stem indirectly influences sensitivity to the drugs. A putative binding site for BMS-806 and \#155 between the gp120 receptor-binding regions and the inner domain, which is thought to interact with the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, helps to explain the mode of action of these drugs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15016894</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.78.7.3742-3752.2004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/78/7/3742</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

These interactions initiate a fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Although gpl20 can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies, HIV eludes the immune system. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed with a two-domain fragment of human CD4 and an antigen-binding fragment of a neutralizing antibody that blocks chemokine-receptor binding. The structure reveals a cavity-laden CD4–gp120 interface, a conserved binding site for the chemokine receptor, evidence for a conformational change upon CD4 binding, the nature of a CD4-induced antibody epitope, and specific mechanisms for immune evasion.

We used analytical ultracentrifugation, titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis to characterize the assembly state, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the CD4-gp120 interaction. The binding thermodynamics were of unexpected magnitude; changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity greatly exceeded those described for typical protein-protein interactions. These unusual thermodynamic properties were observed with both intact gp120 and a deglycosylated and truncated form of gp120 protein that lacked hypervariable loops V1, V2, and V3 and segments of its N and C termini. Together with previous crystallographic studies, the large changes in heat capacity and entropy reveal that extensive structural rearrangements occur within the core of gp120 upon CD4 binding. CD spectral studies and slow kinetics of binding support this conclusion. These results indicate considerable conformational flexibility within gp120, which may relate to viral mechanisms for triggering infection and disguising conserved receptor-binding sites from the immune system.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10922058</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.97.16.9026</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/97/16/9026</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here we show that, in contrast to the CD4 domain 1 MAb 6H10, 5A8 and its Fab fragment do not block soluble CD4 (sCD4) binding to virions, whereas they do inhibit sCD4-induced exposure of cryptic epitopes on gp41 and dissociation of gp120 from virions. Two other MAbs, OKT4 and L120, which are reactive with domains 3 and 4 of CD4, have little or no effect on HIV-1 infection, syncytium formation, or sCD4-induced conformational changes in the envelope glycoproteins. The mechanisms of action of 5A8 and 6H10 can be further distinguished in syncytium inhibition assays: 6H10 blocks competitively, while 5A8 does not. We opine that 5A8 blocks HIV-1 infection and fusion by interfering with conformational changes in gp120/gp41 and/or CD4 that are necessary for virus-cell fusion.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1378510</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/66/8/4784</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

BMS-378806 is selective for HIV-1 and inactive against HIV-2, SIV and a panel of other viruses, and exhibits no significant cytotoxicity in the 14 cell types tested (concentration for 50\% reduction of cell growth, \textgreater225 μM). Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that BMS-378806 binds to gp120 and inhibits the interactions of the HIV-1 envelope protein to cellular CD4 receptors. Further confirmation that BMS-378806 targets the envelope in infected cells was obtained through the isolation of resistant variants and the mapping of resistance substitutions to the HIV-1 envelope. In particular, two substitutions, M426L and M475I, are situated in the CD4 binding pocket of gp120. Recombinant HIV-1 carrying these two substitutions demonstrated significantly reduced susceptibility to compound inhibition. BMS-378806 displays many favorable pharmacological traits, such as low protein binding, minimal human serum effect on anti-HIV-1 potency, good oral bioavailability in animal species, and a clean safety profile in initial animal toxicology studies. Together, the data show that BMS-378806 is a representative of a new class of HIV inhibitors that has the potential to become a valued addition to our current armamentarium of antiretroviral drugs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12930892</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.1832214100</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/100/19/11013</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here, we demonstrate that the compound targets viral entry by inhibiting the binding of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein to cellular CD4 receptors via a specific and competitive mechanism. BMS-378806 binds directly to gp120 at a stoichiometry of approximately 1:1, with a binding affinity similar to that of soluble CD4. The potential BMS-378806 target site was localized to a specific region within the CD4 binding pocket of gp120 by using HIV-1 gp120 variants carrying either compound-selected resistant substitutions or gp120-CD4 contact site mutations. Mapping of resistance substitutions to the HIV-1 envelope, and the lack of compound activity against a CD4-independent viral infection confirm the gp120-CD4 interactions as the target in infected cells. BMS-378806 therefore serves as a prototype for this new class of antiretroviral agents and validates gp120 as a viable target for small-molecule inhibitors.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12970437</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.77.19.10528-10536.2003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/19/10528</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Progressive deletions were introduced in the N-terminal extracellular domain of CXCR-4 and the effect on infection by different isolates was tested. Infection of cells expressing the different CXCR-4 deletion mutants by HIV-1 LAI and 89.6 was reduced only about twofold. In contrast, the HIV-1 GUN-1 and RF isolates were substantially more impaired in their ability to mediate cell-free infection and cell–cell fusion. Since LAI and RF are T-cell line-tropic viruses while 89.6 and GUN-1 are dual tropic, no clear correlation between tropism and requirements for CXCR-4 N-terminal sequences emerged. We also introduced point mutations at the two N-linked glycosylation sites. The isolates tested (LAI, RF, GUN-1, and 89.6) were not affected by the removal of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in CXCR-4. We conclude that distinct virus strains interact differently with the CXCR-4 coreceptor and that the N-terminal extracellular domain is not the sole functional domain important for HIV-1 entry.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/viro.1997.8506</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297985068</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Although receptor chimera studies have provided useful information, the domains of CCR5 that function for HIV-1 entry, including the site of gp120 interaction, have not been unambiguously identified. Here, we use site-directed, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of CCR5 to show that substitutions of the negatively charged aspartic acid residues at positions 2 and 11 (D2A and D11A) and a glutamic acid residue at position 18 (E18A), individually or in combination, impair or abolish CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry for the ADA and JR-FL M-tropic strains and the DH123 dual-tropic strain. These mutations also impair Env-mediated membrane fusion and the gp120-CCR5 interaction. Of these three residues, only D11 is necessary for CC-chemokine-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 entry, which is, however, also dependent on other extracellular CCR5 residues. Thus, the gp120 and CC-chemokine binding sites on CCR5 are only partially overlapping, and the former site requires negatively charged residues in the amino-terminal CCR5 domain.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9420225</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/72/1/279</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To understand the molecular basis of the binding of chemokines and HIV-1 to CCR5, we developed a number of mAbs that inhibit the various interactions of CCR5, and mapped the binding sites of these mAbs using a panel of CCR5/CCR2b chimeras. One mAb termed 2D7 completely blocked the binding and chemotaxis of the three natural chemokine ligands of CCR5, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β, to CCR5 transfectants. This mAb was a genuine antagonist of CCR5, since it failed to stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the CCR5 transfectants, but blocked calcium responses elicited by RANTES, MIP-1α, or MIP-1β. This mAb inhibited most of the RANTES and MIP-1α chemotactic responses of activated T cells, but not of monocytes, suggesting differential usage of chemokine receptors by these two cell types. The 2D7 binding site mapped to the second extracellular loop of CCR5, whereas a group of mAbs that failed to block chemokine binding all mapped to the NH2-terminal region of CCR5. Efficient inhibition of an M-tropic HIV-1–derived envelope glycoprotein gp120 binding to CCR5 could be achieved with mAbs recognizing either the second extracellular loop or the NH2-terminal region, although the former showed superior inhibition. Additionally, 2D7 efficiently blocked the infectivity of several M-tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains in vitro. These results suggest a complicated pattern of HIV-1 gp120 binding to different regions of CCR5, but a relatively simple pattern for chemokine binding. We conclude that the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is an ideal target site for the development of inhibitors of either chemokine or HIV-1 binding to CCR5.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9334377</NOTES><URL>10.1084/jem.186.8.1373</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jem.rupress.org/content/186/8/1373</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The epitopes for these mAbs were determined by using various CCR5 mutants, including CCR5/CCR2B chimeras. One mAb, ROAb13, was found to bind to a linear epitope in the N terminus of CCR5. Strikingly, the other five mAbs bind to epitopes derived from extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). The three most potent mAbs, ROAb12, ROAb14, and ROAb18, require residues from both the N-terminal (Lys171 and Glu172) and C-terminal (Trp190) halves of ECL2 for binding; two other mAbs, ROAb10 and ROAb51, which also showed potent antiviral activities, require Lys171 and Glu172 but not Trp190 for binding. Binding of the control mAb 2D7 completely relies on Lys171 and Glu172. Unlike 2D7, the novel mAbs ROAb12, ROAb14, and ROAb18 do not bind to the linear peptide 2D7-2SK. In addition, all three mAbs bind to monkey CCR5 (with Arg at position 171 instead of Lys); however, 2D7 does not. Since five of the six most potent CCR5 mAbs derived from the same pool of immunized mice require ECL2 as epitopes, we hypothesize that CCR5 ECL2 contains the dominant epitopes for mAbs with potent antiviral activities. These dominant epitopes were found in CCR5 from multiple species and were detected in large proportions of the total cell surface CCR5. mAbs recognizing these epitopes also showed high binding affinity. A homology model of CCR5 was generated to aid in the interpretation of these dominant epitopes in ECL2.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17242138</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.01302-06</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/51/4/1386</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In this study, we found that TAK-779, a nonpeptide compound with a small molecular weight (Mr 531.13), antagonized the binding of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) to CCR5-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and blocked CCR5-mediated Ca2+ signaling at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibition of β-chemokine receptors by TAK-779 appeared to be specific to CCR5 because the compound antagonized CCR2b to a lesser extent but did not affect CCR1, CCR3, or CCR4. Consequently, TAK-779 displayed highly potent and selective inhibition of R5 HIV-1 replication without showing any cytotoxicity to the host cells. The compound inhibited the replication of R5 HIV-1 clinical isolates as well as a laboratory strain at a concentration of 1.6–3.7 nM in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, though it was totally inactive against T-cell line-tropic (CXCR4-using or X4) HIV-1.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10318947</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.96.10.5698</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/96/10/5698</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, no study to date has examined whether monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, or other nonchemokine agents possess broad-spectrum activity against the major genetic subtypes of HIV-1. PRO 140 (PA14) is an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits HIV-1 entry at concentrations that do not affect CCR5's chemokine receptor activity. In this study, PRO 140 was tested against a panel of primary HIV-1 isolates selected for their genotypic and geographic diversity. In quantitative assays of viral infectivity, PRO 140 was compared with RANTES, a natural CCR5 ligand that can inhibit HIV-1 entry by receptor downregulation as well as receptor blockade. Despite their divergent mechanisms of action and binding epitopes on CCR5, low nanomolar concentrations of both PRO 140 and RANTES inhibited infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by all CCR5-using (R5) viruses tested. This is consistent with there being a highly restricted pattern of CCR5 usage by R5 viruses. In addition, a panel of 25 subtype C South African R5 viruses were broadly inhibited by PRO 140, RANTES, and TAK-779, although ∼30-fold-higher concentrations of the last compound were required. Interestingly, significant inhibition of a dualtropic subtype C virus was also observed. Whereas PRO 140 potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in both PBMC and primary macrophages, RANTES exhibited limited antiviral activity in macrophage cultures. Thus CCR5-targeting agents such as PRO 140 can demonstrate potent and genetic-subtype-independent anti-HIV-1 activity.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11134270</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.75.2.579-588.2001</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/75/2/579</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Currently, several novel coreceptor inhibitors are being developed in the clinic, and early results have proven promising. In this report, we describe a novel CCR5 antagonist, vicriviroc (formerly SCH-D or SCH 417690), with improved antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic properties compared to those of SCH-C, a previously described CCR5 antagonist. Like SCH-C, vicriviroc binds specifically to the CCR5 receptor and prevents infection of target cells by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolates. In antiviral assays, vicriviroc showed potent, broad-spectrum activity against genetically diverse and drug-resistant HIV-1 isolates and was consistently more active than SCH-C in inhibiting viral replication. This compound demonstrated synergistic anti-HIV activity in combination with drugs from all other classes of approved antiretrovirals. Competition binding assays revealed that vicriviroc binds with higher affinity to CCR5 than SCH-C. Functional assays, including inhibition of calcium flux, guanosine 5′-[35S]triphosphate exchange, and chemotaxis, confirmed that vicriviroc acts as a receptor antagonist by inhibiting signaling of CCR5 by chemokines. Finally, vicriviroc demonstrated diminished affinity for the human ether a-go-go related gene transcript ion channel compared to SCH-C, suggesting a reduced potential for cardiac effects. Vicriviroc represents a promising new candidate for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16304152</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.49.12.4911-4919.2005</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/49/12/4911</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Vicriviroc, an investigational CCR5 inhibitor, demonstrated short-term antiretroviral activity in a phase 1 study. Methods. The present study was a double-blind, randomized phase 2 study of vicriviroc in treatment-experienced, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected subjects experiencing virologic failure while receiving a ritonavir-containing regimen with an HIV-1 RNA level ⩾5000 copies/mL and CCR5-using virus. Vicriviroc at 5, 10, or 15 mg or placebo was added to the failing regimen for 14 days, after which the antiretroviral regimen was optimized. The primary end point was the change in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at day 14; secondary end points included safety/tolerability and HIV-1 RNA level changes at week 24. Results. One hundred eighteen subjects were randomized with a median HIV-1 RNA level of 36,380 (4.56 log10) copies/mL and a median CD4 cell count of 146 cells/mm3. At 14 days and 24 weeks, mean changes in HIV-1 RNA level (log10 copies/mL) were greater in the vicriviroc groups (−0.87 and −1.51 [5 mg], −1.15 and −1.86 [10 mg], and −0.92 and −1.68 [15 mg]), than in the placebo group (+0.06 and −0.29) (P\textless.01). Grade 3/4 adverse events were similar across groups. Malignancies occurred in 6 subjects randomized to vicriviroc and in 2 to placebo. Conclusions. In HIV-1–infected, treatment-experienced patients, vicriviroc demonstrated potent virologic suppression through 24 weeks. The relationship of vicriviroc to malignancy is uncertain. Further development of vicriviroc in treatment-experienced patients is warranted.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17570119</NOTES><URL>10.1086/518797</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/196/2/304</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The CCR5 coreceptor is used by the most commonly transmitted HIV-1 strains that often persist throughout the course of infection. Compounds targeting CCR5-mediated entry are a novel class of drugs being developed to treat HIV-1 infection. In this study, we have identified the mechanism of action of two inhibitors of CCR5 function, SCH-350581 (AD101) and SCH-351125 (SCH-C). AD101 is more potent than SCH-C at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in primary lymphocytes, as well as viral entry and gp120 binding to cell lines. Both molecules also block the binding of several anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes in the second extracellular loop of CCR5. Alanine mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of CCR5 suggests that AD101 and SCH-C bind to overlapping but nonidentical sites within a putative ligand-binding cavity formed by transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, and 7. We propose that the binding of small molecules to the transmembrane domain of CCR5 may disrupt the conformation of its extracellular domain, thereby inhibiting ligand binding to CCR5.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12692222</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.77.9.5201-5208.2003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/9/5201</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The integration of these models in a pharmacokinetic (PK)–pharmacodynamic (PD)–disease model can help toward a better understanding of the complexity of the interactions, as well as in the identification and clarification of the current model assumptions.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.clpt.2005.07.010</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/clpt/journal/v78/n5/abs/clpt2005526a.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, recent data from the MOTIVATE trials indicate that R5 HIV-1 can develop resistance to Maraviroc, underscoring the need for additional CCR5 antagonists. The CCR5 antagonist aplaviroc (APL) is active against Maraviroc-resistant viral strains but its clinical development has ended because of dose-related toxicity. Here we demonstrate that reduction of CCR5 density (receptors/cell) with the immunomodulatory drug rapamycin (RAPA) enhances the antiviral activity of APL, allowing lower, non-toxic effective doses. In the presence of RAPA, the concentration of APL required for 90\% inhibition of R5 HIV-1 in primary CD4 lymphocytes was reduced by as much as 25-fold. We conclude that low doses of RAPA may reduce the anti-HIV effective dose of APL-derivatives currently in development and thus minimize their potential toxicity. Combinations of RAPA and CCR5 antagonists could provide an effective means to control drug-resistant R5 HIV in patients, most notably those infected with Maraviroc-resistant viruses.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.02.199</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209002423</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Both studies (and, ultimately, the clinical development of APL) were discontinued after a mean of 14 weeks of therapy because of higher than anticipated severe liver toxicity; grade 2 or higher treatment-emergent elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were observed in 17/281 (6.0\%) APL recipients but only 2/55 (3.6\%) control recipients, while grade 2 or higher elevations in total bilirubin levels occurred in 29/281 (10.3\%) APL recipients but only 4/55 (7.3\%) controls. Two APL recipients developed grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent elevations in both ALT and total bilirubin levels, and one of these individuals had a severe case of hepatic cytolysis that was attributed to APL. Despite the high intersubject variability in APL plasma exposures, a Pearson correlation analysis of the combined study data did not reveal any significant associations between plasma concentrations and the liver enzyme elevations observed during the study. The mechanism for the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity observed in the clinical trials of APL is unknown but is likely intrinsic to the molecule rather than its novel mechanism of action.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 18070967</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.00821-07</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/52/3/858</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

This switch is associated with an accelerated loss of CD4+ T-cells and a faster progression to AIDS. Despite intensive research, the mechanisms responsible for coreceptor switch remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated associations between viral evolutionary rate and selection pressure versus viral coreceptor use and rate of disease progression in eight patients with longitudinally sampled HIV-1 env V1-–V3 sequences. By employing a Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic model, we found that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than with rate of disease progression in terms of CD4+T-cell decline. Phylogenetic analyses showed that X4 variants evolved from R5 populations. In addition, coreceptor switch was associated with higher evolutionary rates on both the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution level, but not with dN/dS ratio rates. Our findings suggest that X4 viruses evolved from pre-existing R5 viral populations and that the evolution of coreceptor switch is governed by high replication rates rather than by selective pressure. Furthermore, the association of viral evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than disease progression. This adds to the understanding of the complex virus–host interplay that influences the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 coreceptor use.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.meegid.2013.05.004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813001895</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Early in infection the primary coreceptor is CCR5, but during disease course CXCR4-using HIV-1 populations may emerge. This has been correlated with accelerated disease progression in HIV-1 subtype B. Basic knowledge of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism is important due to the recent introduction of coreceptor antagonists in antiretroviral therapy, and subtype-specific differences regarding how frequently HIV-1 CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage disease need to be further investigated. To study how frequently CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage disease among HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02\_AG, we evaluated the accuracy of a recombinant virus phenotypic assay for these subtypes, and used it to determine the HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of plasma samples collected during late-stage disease in Guinea-Bissau. We also performed a genotypic analysis and investigated subtype-specific differences in the appearance of CXCR4 tropism late in disease.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 20307309</NOTES><URL>10.1186/1742-4690-7-23</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/23/abstract</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Thirty fasting healthy male volunteers received oral doses of AMD070 ranging from a single 50-mg dose to seven 400-mg doses given every 12 h (q12h). Nine subjects received a 200-mg dose during fasting and prior to a meal. Subjects were monitored for safety and pharmacokinetics. AMD070 was well tolerated, without serious adverse events. Transient headaches (13 subjects) and neurocognitive (8 subjects) and gastrointestinal (7 subjects) symptoms were the most common complaints. Seven subjects had sinus tachycardia, and two were symptomatic. AMD070 plasma concentrations peaked 1 to 2 h after patient dosing. The estimated terminal half-life ranged from 11.2 to 15.9 h among cohorts. Dose proportionality was not demonstrated. Less than 1\% of the drug appeared unchanged in the urine. Food reduced the maximum concentration of drug in serum and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h by 70\% and 56\%, respectively (P ≤ 0.01). A dose-dependent elevation of white blood cells (WBC) demonstrated a maximum twofold increase over baseline (95\% confidence interval, 2.0- to 2.1-fold) in an Emax model. In healthy volunteers, AMD070 was well tolerated and demonstrated mixed-order pharmacokinetics, and food reduced drug exposure. AMD070 induced a dose-related elevation of WBC which was attributed to CXCR4 blockade. Using leukocytosis as a surrogate marker for CXCR4 inhibition, this dose-response relationship suggests that the doses used in this study were active in vivo, though not maximal, throughout the dosing interval. Trough concentrations with the 400-mg dose q12h exceeded the antiviral in vitro 90\% effective concentration of AMD070.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17452489</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.00013-07</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/51/7/2351</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

It also inhibited binding of the CXC chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor 1α, to CXCR4 specifically and subsequent signal transduction. KRH-1636 prevented monoclonal antibodies from binding to CXCR4 without down-modulation of the coreceptor. The inhibitory effect against X4 viral replication by KRH-1636 was clearly reproduced in the human peripheral blood lymphocyte/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse system. Furthermore, this compound was absorbed into the blood after intraduodenal administration as judged by anti-HIV-1 activity and liquid chromatography MS in the plasma. Thus, KRH-1636 seems to be a promising agent for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12642669</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.0630420100</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/100/7/4185</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The gp120 surface subunit of Env binds cell receptors to attach virus to target cells and regulate viral entry. The gp41 transmembrane subunit fuses host-cell and viral membranes to deliver the viral core into the cell cytoplasm. The two subunits derive from a polyprotein precursor, gp160. Cleavage of gp160 in the biosynthetic pathway creates mature Env consisting of the noncovalently-associated gp120/gp41 that is primed for viral entry. While performing distinct operations in HIV entry, the activities of the gp120 and gp41 subunits must be highly coordinated in order to lead to successful infection. This review highlights structure-function relationships in Env, with a focus on the heptad-repeat regions in the ectodomain of gp41. The mechanism of Env-mediated membrane fusion and ways to interfere with this process using inhibitors and antibodies that target gp41 are discussed.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15012000</NOTES></RECORD>

Abstracts from infectious diseases and HIV scientific meetings were identified. data extraction: All publications and meeting abstracts were reviewed and relevant items included. In vitro and preclinical studies were included, as well as Phase II and III clinical trials. data synthesis: Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Given its unique mechanism of action, most HIV-1 isolates are susceptible to enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide is administered by subcutaneous injection twice daily. In clinical trials with antiretroviral-experienced patients, enfuvirtide was effective at suppressing HIV-RNA and increasing CD4+ T-cell counts. Enfuvirtide should be used in combination with other active antiretroviral agents to optimize its efficacy and limit resistance. Injection site reactions associated with administration of the drug are experienced in the majority of patients. Availability of enfuvirtide may be limited by a complex manufacturing procedure. conclusions: Enfuvirtide is an effective treatment option for HIV-1-infected individuals when used in combination with other antiretroviral agents.

Searching for more drugs in this category with higher efficacy and lower toxicity seems to be a logical next step. In line with this objective, a synthetic peptide with 36 amino acid residues, called Sifuvirtide (SFT), was designed based on the crystal structure of gp41. In this study, we show that SFT is a potent anti-HIV agent with relatively low cytotoxicity. SFT was found to inhibit replication of all tested HIV strains. The effective concentrations that inhibited 50\% viral replication (EC50), as determined in all tested strains, were either comparable or lower than benchmark values derived from well-known anti-HIV drugs like ENF or AZT, while the cytotoxic concentrations causing 50\% cell death (CC50) were relatively high, rendering it an ideal anti-HIV agent. A GST-pull down assay was performed to confirm that SFT is a fusion inhibitor. Furthermore, the activity of SFT on other targets in the HIV life cycle was also investigated, and all assays showed negative results. To further understand the mechanism of action of HIV peptide inhibitors, resistant variants of HIV-1IIIB were derived by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of SFT or ENF. The results showed that there was cross-resistance between SFT and ENF. In conclusion, SFT is an ideal anti-HIV agent with high potency and low cytotoxicity, but may exhibit a certain extent of cross-resistance with ENF.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.03.057</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X09005221</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In this review, the molecular basis of resistance to RT and PR inhibitors will be addressed, focusing on the mutations that confer resistance to nucleoside and non-nucleoside drugs. The emergence of multidrug-resistant viruses results from the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy and involves the combined effects of different drug-resistance mutations.

Fifty percent inhibitory dose (ID50) values of 18 isolates from untreated individuals ranged between 0.01 microM and 0.05 microM. In contrast, most isolates from patients who had received zidovudine for 6 months or more exhibited decreased sensitivity characterized by changes in ID50 or ID95 values (or both), with isolates from several patients (5/15) showing 100-fold increases in ID50. The latter isolates were also insensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine; however, the isolates were still sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine, or phosphonoformate. It cannot be determined from this small sample of patients whether development of a less sensitive virus phenotype results in clinical resistance. Appearance of such variants was not associated with a consistent increase in viral p24 concentrations in patient plasma and did not herald any sudden deterioration in clinical status. More extensive studies are required to determine the clinical significance. Thus, it would be premature to alter any treatment protocols for HIV-infected individuals at present.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2467383</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.2467383</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/243/4899/1731</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Like other retroviral reverse transcriptases, the HIV-1 enzyme does not correct errors by exonucleolytic proofreading. Measurements with M13mp2-based fidelity assays indicated that the HIV-1 enzyme, isolated either from virus particles or from Escherichia coli cells infected with a plasmid expressing the cloned gene, was exceptionally inaccurate, having an average error rate per detectable nucleotide incorporated of 1/1700. It was, in fact, the least accurate reverse transcriptase described to date, one-tenth as accurate as the polymerases isolated from avian myeloblastosis or murine leukemia viruses, which have average error rates of approximately 1/17,000 and approximately 1/30,000, respectively. DNA sequence analyses of mutations generated by HIV-1 polymerase showed that base substitution, addition, and deletion errors were all produced. Certain template positions were mutational hotspots where the error rate could be as high as 1 per 70 polymerized nucleotides. The data are consistent with the notion that the exceptional diversity of the HIV-1 genome results from error-prone reverse transcription.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2460925</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.2460925</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/242/4882/1171</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Single mutations at residue 184 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) in HIV cause high-level resistance to 3TC and contribute to the failure of anti-AIDS combination therapy. We have determined crystal structures of the 3TC-resistant mutant HIV-1 RT (M184I) in both the presence and absence of a DNA/DNA template-primer. In the absence of a DNA substrate, the wild-type and mutant structures are very similar. However, comparison of crystal structures of M184I mutant and wild-type HIV-1 RT with and without DNA reveals repositioning of the template-primer in the M184I/DNA binary complex and other smaller changes in residues in the dNTP-binding site. On the basis of these structural results, we developed a model that explains the ability of the 3TC-resistant mutant M184I to incorporate dNTPs but not the nucleotide analog 3TCTP. In this model, steric hindrance is expected for NRTIs with β- or l- ring configurations, as with the enantiomer of 3TC that is used in therapy. Steric conflict between the oxathiolane ring of 3TCTP and the side chain of β-branched amino acids (Val, Ile, Thr) at position 184 perturbs inhibitor binding, leading to a reduction in incorporation of the analog. The model can also explain the 3TC resistance of analogous hepatitis B polymerase mutants. Repositioning of the template-primer as observed in the binary complex (M184I/DNA) may also occur in the catalytic ternary complex (M184I/DNA/3TCTP) and contribute to 3TC resistance by interfering with the formation of a catalytically competent closed complex.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10468556</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.96.18.10027</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10027</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Particular inhibitors select characteristic resistance mutations. In the case of the nucleoside analogs 3TC and FTC, resistant viruses are selected with mutations at amino acid residue 184 of reverse transcriptase (RT). The initial change is usually to M184I; this virus is rapidly replaced by a variant carrying the mutation M184V. 3TC and FTC are taken up by cells and converted into 3TCTP and FTCTP. The triphosphate forms of these nucleoside analogs are incorporated into DNA by HIV-1 RT and act as chain terminators. Both of the mutations, M184I and M184V, provide very high levels of resistance in vivo; purified HIV-1 RT carrying M184V and M184I also shows resistance to 3TCTP and FTCTP in in vitro polymerase assays. Amino acid M184 is part of the dNTP binding site of HIV-1 RT. Structural studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance of HIV-1 RTs carrying the M184V or M184I mutation involves steric hindrance, which could either completely block the binding of 3TCTP and FTCTP or allow binding of these nucleoside triphosphate molecules but only in a configuration that would prevent incorporation. The available kinetic data are ambiguous: one group has reported that the primary effect of the mutations is at the level of 3TCTP binding; another, at the level of incorporation. We have approached this problem using assays that monitor the ability of HIV-1 RT to undergo a conformational change upon binding a dNTP. These studies show that both wild-type RT and the drug-resistant variants can bind 3TCTP at the polymerase active site; however, the binding to M184V and M184I is somewhat weaker and is sensitive to salt. We propose that the drug-resistant variants bind 3TCTP in a strained configuration that is salt-sensitive and is not catalytically competent.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/jmbi.2000.3823</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283600938233</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Of particular concern are mutations that cause cross-resistance to a particular class of drugs. Among the mutations that cause resistance to several nucleoside analogs are the insertion of amino acids in the fingers subdomain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) at positions 69 and 70. These insertions are usually associated with changes in the flanking amino acids and with a change to F or Y at position 215. We have proposed that the T215F/Y mutation makes the binding of ATP to HIV-1 RT more effective, which increases the excision of 3-azido-3′-deoxythymidine-5′-monophosphate (AZTMP) in vitro and increases zidovudine (AZT) resistance in vivo. Although the mechanism of AZT resistance involves enhanced excision, resistance to 3TC involves a block to incorporation of the analog. We measured the effects of fingers insertion mutations on the misincorporation and excision of several nucleoside analogs. RT variants with the amino acid insertions in the fingers and T215Y have a decreased level of misincorporation of ddATP and 3TCTP. These mutants also have the ability to excise AZTMP by ATP-dependent pyrophosphorylysis. However, unlike the classic AZT resistance mutations (M41L/D67N/K70R/T215Y or F/K219E or Q), the combination of the amino acid insertions in the fingers and the T215Y mutation allows efficient excision of ddTMP and d4TMP, even when relatively high levels of deoxynucleoside triphosphates are present in the reaction. Although the dideoxynucleoside analogs of other nucleosides were excised more slowly than AZTMP, ddTMP, and d4TMP, the mutants with the fingers insertion and T215Y excised all of the nucleoside analogs that were tested more efficiently than wild-type RT or a mutant RT carrying the classical AZT resistance mutations. In the ternary complex (RT/template-primer/dNTP), the presence of the bound dNTP prevents the end of the primer from gaining access to the nucleotide binding site (N site) where excision occurs. Gel shift analysis showed that the amino acid insertions in the fingers destabilized the ternary complex compared to wild-type HIV-1 RT. If the ternary complex is unstable, the end of the primer can gain access to the N site and excision can occur. This could explain the enhanced excision of the nucleoside analogs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12186898</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.76.18.9143-9151.2002</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/18/9143</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

While this resistance could be unequivocally correlated with multiple mutations in HIV reverse transcriptase (D67N, K70R, T215F/Y, K219Q), the mechanism or phenotype for this resistance has remained obscure for more than a decade, despite active investigation. Recent studies indicate that AZT resistance may be related to removal of chain-terminating AZT from the 3′-terminus of the primer, by a process known as pyrophosphorolysis. This process is catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), and is the reverse reaction of DNA polymerization. The D67N/K70R mutations result in a significantly increased rate of RT-catalyzed pyrophosphorolysis at physiological levels of pyrophosphate, which leads to a decrease in the extent of AZT chain termination of nascent viral DNA. The potential replication deficit of an increased reverse reaction during DNA synthesis is compensated by increased DNA synthesis processivity, a phenotype that results from the T215F/Y/K219Q mutations in RT. The net result of these multiple phenotypes imparted by the multiple mutations in RT is the facile synthesis of full-length viral DNA in the presence of AZT.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1054/drup.1999.0076</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368764699900766</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, mutant RT extended 12\% to 15\% of primers past multiple AZTMP termination sites versus less than 0.5\% for wild type. Although mutant RT also unblocked ddAMP-terminated primers more efficiently than wild-type RT, the removal of ddAMP was effectively inhibited by the next complementary dNTP (IC50 ≈ 12 μM).

Recombinant virus carrying this variant RT (termed SS RT) showed reduced susceptibility to all nucleoside RT inhibitors in clinical use, particularly to AZT. In the presence of ATP, recombinant SS RT had an increased ability to remove the 3'-terminal nucleotide from AZT- terminated primers and extend the unblocked primer, compared with wild-type HIV-1 RT (BH10 isolate). Insertion of two serines in the sequence context of BH10 RT did not affect the ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity of the enzyme, and had no influence in resistance to RT inhibitors. However, SS RT mutants lacking the dipeptide insertion or bearing a four-serine insertion showed reduced ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity that correlated with increased AZT sensitivity, as determined using a recombinant virus assay.

It has been clear for some time that there are mutations that selectively interfere with the incorporation of nucleoside analogs; however, it has only recently been proposed that zidovudine (AZT) resistance can involve the excision of the nucleoside analog after it has been incorporated into viral DNA. Although this proposal resolves some important issues, it leaves some questions unanswered. In particular, how do the AZT resistance mutations enhance excision, and what mechanism(s) causes the excision reaction to be relatively specific for AZT? We have used both structural and biochemical data to develop a model. In this model, several of the mutations associated with AZT resistance act primarily to enhance the binding of ATP, which is the most likely pyrophosphate donor in the in vivo excision reaction. The AZT resistance mutations serve to increase the affinity of RT for ATP so that, at physiological ATP concentrations, excision is reasonably efficient. So far as we can determine, the specificity of the excision reaction for an AZT-terminated primer is not due to the mutations that confer resistance, but depends instead on the structure of the region around the HIV-1 RT polymerase active site and on its interactions with the azido group of AZT. Steric constraints involving the azido group cause the end of an AZT 5′-monophosphate-terminated primer to preferentially reside at the nucleotide binding site, which favors excision.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11312355</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.75.10.4832-4842.2001</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/75/10/4832</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than thirty structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are (or have been) in preclinical and/or clinical development [tivirapine (TIBO R-86183), loviride (α-APA R89439), thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097, DMP 266 (efavirenz), PETT derivatives (trovirdine, PETT-4, PETT-5) and the dichlorophenylthio(pyridyl)imidazole derivative S-1153]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific ‘pocket’ site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, preferably in combination with other anti-HIV agents, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has been shown to ‘knock-out’ virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations containing NNRTIs, NRTIs and/or PIs may result in an effective viral suppression and ensuing immune recovery. However, this so-called HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) may also fail, and this necessitates the design of new and more effective drugs and drug cocktails.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0014-827X(98)00103-7</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014827X98001037</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Drugs that inhibit RT are either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Combinations of various anti-AIDS drugs (highly active anti-retroviral therapies or HAART) can reduce the viral load to non-detectable levels. However, the development of drug resistance leads to the emergence of HIV strains that are resistant to multiple anti-AIDS drugs. The nucleotide analogs that are used as anti-HIV-1 drugs lack the normal 3′-OH and as a consequence act as chain-terminators when incorporated into DNA. One mechanism of nucleoside analog resistance involves ATP-based excision to unblock chain-terminated primers and allow HIV replication to continue. There is an urgent need for new drugs and for new therapies that can overcome the excision mechanism of resistance. Compounds that disrupt the binding of the excision reaction substrate(s) (the blocked primer and/or ATP and/or pyrophosphate), or mimic the dinucleoside tetraphosphate product of the ATP-based excision reaction are potential inhibitors of excision. Detailed understanding of drug resistance mechanisms can reveal novel targets for anti-viral agents.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.biocel.2004.02.027</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272504001001</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

By comparison second generation inhibitors, for instance the drug efavirenz, show much greater resilience to these mutations. In order to understand the structural basis for these differences we have determined a series of seven crystal structures of mutant RTs in complexes with first and second generation NNRTIs as well as one example of an unliganded mutant RT. These are Tyr181Cys RT (TNK-651) to 2.4 Å, Tyr181Cys RT (efavirenz) to 2.6 Å, Tyr181Cys RT (nevirapine) to 3.0 Å, Tyr181Cys RT (PETT-2) to 3.0 Å, Tyr188Cys RT (nevirapine) to 2.6 Å, Tyr188Cys RT (UC-781) to 2.6 Å and Tyr188Cys RT (unliganded) to 2.8 Å resolution. In the two previously published structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with mutations at 181 or 188 no side-chain electron density was observed within the p66 subunit (which contains the inhibitor binding pocket) for the mutated residues. In contrast the mutated side-chains can be seen in the NNRTI pocket for all seven structures reported here, eliminating the possibility that disordering contributes to the mechanism of resistance. In the case of the second generation compounds efavirenz with Tyr181Cys RT and UC-781 with Tyr188Cys RT there are only small rearrangements of either inhibitor within the binding site compared to wild-type RT and also for the first generation compounds TNK-651, PETT-2 and nevirapine with Tyr181Cys RT. For nevirapine with the Tyr188Cys RT there is however a more substantial movement of the drug molecule. We conclude that protein conformational changes and rearrangements of drug molecules within the mutated sites are not general features of these particular inhibitor/mutant combinations. The main contribution to drug resistance for Tyr181Cys and Tyr188Cys RT mutations is the loss of aromatic ring stacking interactions for first generation compounds, providing a simple explanation for the resilience of second generation NNRTIs, as such interactions make much less significant contribution to their binding.

HIV-1 resistance to foscarnet has not been reported despite long-term foscarnet therapy of AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus disease. We therefore attempted to select foscarnet-resistant HIV-1 in vitro by serial endpoint passage of virus in 400 microM foscarnet. After 13 cycles of passage in MT-2 cells, virus exhibiting \textgreater or = 8.5-fold foscarnet resistance was isolated. The reverse transcriptase (RT) from resistant virions exhibited a similar level of foscarnet resistance in enzyme inhibition assays (approximately 10-fold resistance). Foscarnet-resistant virus showed increased susceptibility to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (90-fold) and to the HIV-1-specific RT inhibitors TIBO R82150 (30-fold) and nevirapine (20-fold). DNA sequence analysis of RT clones from resistant virus revealed the coexistence of two mutations in all clones: Gln-161 to Leu (CAA to CTA) and His-208 to Tyr (CAT to TAT). Sequence analysis of six clinical HIV-1 isolates showing reduced susceptibility to foscarnet revealed the Tyr-208 mutation in two, the Leu-161 mutation in one, and a Trp-88-to-Ser or -Gly mutation in four isolates. Site-specific mutagenesis and production of mutant recombinant viruses demonstrated that the Leu-161, Ser-88, and Tyr-208 mutations reduced HIV-1 susceptibility to foscarnet 10.5-, 4.3-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, in MT-2 cells. In the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT, the Gln-161 residue lies in the alpha E helix beneath the putative deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) binding site. The Gln-161-to-Leu mutation may affect the structure of the dNTP binding site and its affinity for foscarnet. The location of the Trp-88 residue in the Beta5a strand of HIV-1 RT suggest that the Ser-88 mutation affects template-primer binding, as do several mutations that affect RT susceptibility to nucleoside analogs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7542860</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.39.5.1087</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/39/5/1087</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In particular, the power of molecular and structural biology applied to the drug discovery effort was convincingly demonstrated Initiating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors with dual nucleosides represents the most important treatment development for persons with HIV infection. These inhibitors can significantly reduce the risk for disease progression and death for persons with advanced immune suppression (less than 200 CD4 cells). Clinicians must educate patients regarding the risk and benefit for initiating t this complex therapy and be responsible for selecting a combination that will maximally suppress viral replication. Therapy with HIV-1 protease inhibitor and dual nucleosides may represent the most active combination. Expert clinicians and patients must also balance toxicity, convenience, and adherence with the known beneficial activity associated with HIV-1 protease inhibitors.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065323301560076</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In one, suppression of virus replication occurred and has persisted for 90 weeks (bDNA, \textless 500 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1] RNA copies/ml). In the second group, a rebound in virus levels in plasma followed the initial sharp decline observed at the start of therapy. This was associated with the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Sequence analysis of the protease gene during the course of therapy revealed that in this second group there was a sequential acquisition of protease mutations at amino acids 46, 82, 54, 71, 89, and 90. In the six patients in this group, there was also an identical mutation in the gag p7/p1 gag protease cleavage site. In three of the patients, this change was seen as early as 6 to 10 weeks after the start of therapy. In one patient, a second mutation occurred at the gag p1/p6 cleavage site, but it appeared 18 weeks after the time of appearance of the p7/p1 mutation. Recombinant HIV-1 variants containing two or three mutations in the protease gene were constructed either with mutations at the p7/p1 cleavage site or with wild-type (WT) gag sequences. When recombinant HIV-1-containing protease mutations at 46 and 82 was grown in MT2 cells, there was a 68\% reduction in its rate of replication compared to the WT virus. Introduction of an additional mutation at the gag p7/p1 protease cleavage site compensated for the partially defective protease gene. Similarly, rates of replication of viruses with mutations M46L/I, I54V, and V82A in protease were enhanced both in the presence and in the absence of Indinavir when combined with mutations in the gag p7/p1 and the gag p1/p6 cleavage sites. Optimal rates of virus replication require protease cleavage of precursor polyproteins. A mutation in the cleavage site that enhanced the availability of a protein that was rate limiting for virus maturation would confer on that virus a significant growth advantage and may explain the uniform emergence of viruses with alterations at the p7/p1 cleavage site. This is the first report of the emergence of mutations in the gag p7/p1 protease cleavage sites in patients receiving protease therapy and identifies this change as an important determinant of HIV-1 resistance to protease inhibitors in patient populations.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9261388</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/71/9/6662</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Mutants at valine−82, although insufficient to confer resistance, appeared first in most patients. Significant phenotypic resistance required multiple mutations in HIV protease, which emerged subsequently in an ordered, stepwise fashion. The appearance of resistance mutations was delayed in patients with higher plasma levels of ritonavir. Early mutants retained susceptibility to structurally diverse protease inhibitors, suggesting that dual protease inhibitor therapy might increase the duration of viral suppression.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nm0796-760</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nm/journal/v2/n7/abs/nm0796-760.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Raltegravir also provided clinicians with additional options for first-line therapy and for the simplification of regimens in patients with stable virological suppression. Two additional INIs in advanced clinical development—elvitegravir and S/GSK1349572—may prove equally versatile. However, the INIs have a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance in that 1 or 2 mutations are capable of causing marked reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir and elvitegravir, the most well-studied INIs. This perspective reviews the genetic mechanisms of INI resistance and their implications for initial INI therapy, the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced patients, and regimen simplification.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 21459813</NOTES><URL>10.1093/infdis/jir025</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/203/9/1204</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The RT-RNase H-IN region was PCR amplified from plasma viral RNA obtained from 49 HIV-1 subtype B-infected patients (21 drug naïve and 28 failing highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] not containing InSTIs) and recombined with an HXB2-based backbone with RT and IN deleted. Recombinant viruses were tested against raltegravir and elvitegravir and for replication capacity. Three-hundred forty-four recombinant viruses from 49 patients were successfully analyzed both phenotypically and genotypically. The majority of clones were not phenotypically resistant to InSTIs: 0/344 clones showed raltegravir resistance, and only 3 (0.87\%) showed low-level elvitegravir resistance. No primary resistance mutations for raltegravir and elvitegravir were found as major or minor species. The majority of secondary mutations were also absent or rarely present. Secondary mutations, such as T97A and G140S, found rarely and only as minority quasispecies, were present in the elvitegravir-resistant clones. A novel mutation, E92G, although rarely found in minority quasispecies, showed elvitegravir resistance. Preexisting genotypic and phenotypic raltegravir resistance was extremely rare in InSTI-naïve patients and confined to only a restricted minority of secondary variants. Overall, these results, together with others based on population and ultradeep sequencing, suggest that at this point IN genotyping in all patients before raltegravir treatment may not be cost-effective and should not be recommended until evidence of transmitted drug resistance to InSTIs or the clinical relevance of IN minor variants/polymorphisms is determined.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 20479206</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.01720-09</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/54/9/3938</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We describe here the identification and characterization of L-870,810, a small-molecule inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase with potent antiviral activity in cell culture and good pharmacokinetic properties. L-870,810 is an inhibitor with an 8-hydroxy-(1,6)-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide pharmacophore. The compound inhibits HIV-1 integrase-mediated strand transfer, and its antiviral activity in vitro is a direct consequence of this ascribed effect on integration. L-870,810 is mechanistically identical to previously described inhibitors from the diketo acid series; however, viruses selected for resistance to L-870,810 contain mutations (integrase residues 72, 121, and 125) that uniquely confer resistance to the naphthyridine. Conversely, mutations associated with resistance to the diketo acid do not engender naphthyridine resistance. Importantly, the mutations associated with resistance to each of these inhibitors map to distinct regions within the integrase active site. Therefore, we propose a model of the two inhibitors that is consistent with this observation and suggests specific interactions with discrete binding sites for each ligand. These studies provide a structural basis and rationale for developing integrase inhibitors with the potential for unique and nonoverlapping resistance profiles.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15277684</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.0402357101</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/101/31/11233</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Hazuda, P. Felock, M. Witmer, A. Wolfe, K. Stillmock, J. A. Grobler, A. Espeseth, L. Gabryelski, W. Schleif, C. Blau, and M. D. Miller, Science 287:646-650, 2000). We have now studied the development of antiviral resistance to L-708,906 by growing HIV-1 strains in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compound. The mutations T66I, L74M, and S230R emerged successively in the integrase gene. The virus with three mutations (T66I L74M S230R) was 10-fold less susceptible to L-708,906, while displaying the sensitivity of the wild-type virus to inhibitors of the RT or PRO or viral entry process. Chimeric HIV-1 strains containing the mutant integrase genes displayed the same resistance profile as the in vitro-selected strains, corroborating the impact of the reported mutations on the resistance phenotype. Phenotypic cross-resistance to S-1360, a diketo analogue in clinical trials, was observed for all strains. Interestingly, the diketo acid-resistant strain remained fully sensitive to V-165, a novel integrase inhibitor (C. Pannecouque, W. Pluymers, B. Van Maele, V. Tetz, P. Cherepanov, E. De Clercq, M. Witvrouw, and Z. Debyser, Curr. Biol. 12:1169-1177, 2002). Antiviral resistance was also studied at the level of recombinant integrase. Single mutations did not appear to impair specific enzymatic activity. However, 3′ processing and strand transfer activities of the recombinant integrases with two (T66I L74M) and three (T66I L74M S230R) mutations were notably lower than those of the wild-type integrase. Although the virus with three mutations was resistant to inhibition by diketo acids, the sensitivity of the corresponding enzyme to L-708,906 or S-1360 was reduced only two- to threefold. As to the replication kinetics of the selected strains, the replication fitness for all strains was lower than that of the wild-type HIV-1 strain.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14557631</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.77.21.11459-11470.2003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/77/21/11459</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

As of December 31, 1985, 307 of these cases had been diagnosed in children younger than 13 years of age. The number of cases is increasing rapidly. The number of cases reported in 1985 more than doubled those reported in 1984. The major risk factors in children for acquiring infection with the causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), were (1) having a mother known to be infected and/or at increased risk for infection and (2) receiving a transfusion of blood or blood products. Of the 307 children with AIDS, 73\% were reported from one of four states: New York, New Jersey, Florida, and California. Most AIDS cases in children occur in black or Hispanic infants and toddlers. The estimated incubation period for AIDS in children has increased each surveillance year, with the longest incubation exceeding 7 years. The prognosis for children with AIDS is poor and infants less than 1 year of age have the shortest survival time following diagnosis. Continued national surveillance for AIDS is mandatory for establishing effective prevention programs to control the spread of the disease. The CDC encourages all health care personnel to report cases of AIDS to their public health departments.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 3035476</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/79/6/1008</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The change in coreceptor usage is the result of the complex interaction of the viral population with various cell populations of the immune system. Although many of the molecular processes involved in viral attachment and entry have been resolved, the population dynamical mechanisms leading to the emergence of CXCR4-using HIV variants in some infected individuals are not yet understood. Here, we review various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the change of HIV coreceptor usage in the course of infection, and conclude that any corroboration or rejection of these hypotheses requires a quantitative analysis of the interaction between the virus and immune cells.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.tim.2005.04.005</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X05001101</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here, we describe some properties of clonal viruses resistant to one such inhibitor, SCH-D, using both chimeric, infectious molecular clones and Env-pseudotypes. Studies using combinations of CCR5 ligands, including small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and chemokine derivatives such as PSC-RANTES, show that the fully SCH-D-resistant viruses enter target cells by using the SCH-D-bound form of CCR5. However, the way resistance to SCH-D and other small molecule CCR5 inhibitors is manifested depends on the target cell and the nature of the assay (single- vs. multi-cycle). In multi-cycle assays using primary lymphocytes, SCH-D does not inhibit resistant molecular clones, and it can even enhance their infectivity modestly. In contrast, the same viruses (as Env-pseudotypes) are significantly inhibited by SCH-D in single-cycle entry assays using U87-CD4/CCR5 cells, resistance being manifested by incomplete inhibition at high SCH-D concentrations. When a single-cycle, Env-pseudotype entry assay was performed using either U87-CD4/CCR5 cells or PBMC under comparable conditions, entry was inhibited by up to 88\% in the former cells but by only 28\% in the PBMC. Hence, there are both cell- and assay-dependent influences on how resistance is manifested. We also take this opportunity to correct our previous report that SCH-D-resistant isolates are also substantially cross-resistant to PSC-RANTES [Marozsan, A.J., Kuhmann, S.E., Morgan, T., Herrera, C., Rivera-Troche, E., Xu, S., Baroudy, B.M., Strizki, J., Moore, J.P., 2005.

A substantial element of this resistance was attributable to the unappreciated carry-over of SCH-D from the selection cultures into analytical assays.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.virol.2006.11.004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206008245</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We investigated the mechanism of HIV resistance to maraviroc by using in vitro sequential passage and site-directed mutagenesis. Serial passage through increasing maraviroc concentrations failed to select maraviroc-resistant variants from some laboratory-adapted and clinical isolates of HIV-1. However, high-level resistance to maraviroc was selected from three of six primary isolates passaged in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The SF162 strain acquired resistance to maraviroc in both treated and control cultures; all resistant variants were able to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor. In contrast, maraviroc-resistant virus derived from isolates CC1/85 and RU570 remained CCR5 tropic, as evidenced by susceptibility to the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C, resistance to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, and an inability to replicate in CCR5 Δ32/Δ32 PBL. Strain-specific mutations were identified in the V3 loop of maraviroc-resistant CC1/85 and RU570. The envelope-encoding region of maraviroc-resistant CC1/85 was inserted into an NL4-3 background. This recombinant virus was completely resistant to maraviroc but retained susceptibility to aplaviroc. Reverse mutation of gp120 residues 316 and 323 in the V3 loop (numbering from HXB2) to their original sequence restored wild-type susceptibility to maraviroc, while reversion of either mutation resulted in a partially sensitive virus with reduced maximal inhibition (plateau). The plateaus are consistent with the virus having acquired the ability to utilize maraviroc-bound receptor for entry. This hypothesis was further corroborated by the observation that a high concentration of maraviroc blocks the activity of aplaviroc against maraviroc-resistant virus.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17182681</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.02006-06</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/81/5/2359</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Trkola, S. E. Kuhmann, J. M. Strizki, E. Maxwell, T. Ketas, T. Morgan, P. Pugach, S. X. L. Wojcik, J. Tagat, A. Palani, S. Shapiro, J. W. Clader, S. McCombie, G. R. Reyes, B. M. Baroudy, and J. P. Moore, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:395-400, 2002). The escape mutant, CC101.19, continued to use CCR5 for entry, but it was at least 20,000-fold more resistant to AD101 than the parental virus, CC1/85. We have now cloned the env genes from the the parental and escape mutant isolates and made chimeric infectious molecular clones that fully recapitulate the phenotypes of the corresponding isolates. Sequence analysis of the evolution of the escape mutants suggested that the most relevant changes were likely to be in the V3 loop of the gp120 glycoprotein. We therefore made a series of mutant viruses and found that full AD101 resistance was conferred by four amino acid changes in V3. Each change individually caused partial resistance when they were introduced into the V3 loop of a CC1/85 clone, but their impact was dependent on the gp120 context in which they were made. We assume that these amino acid changes alter how the HIV-1 Env complex interacts with CCR5. Perhaps unexpectedly, given the complete dependence of the escape mutant on CCR5 for entry, monomeric gp120 proteins expressed from clones of the fully resistant isolate failed to bind to CCR5 on the surface of L1.2-CCR5 cells under conditions where gp120 proteins from the parental virus and a partially AD101-resistant virus bound strongly. Hence, the full impact of the V3 substitutions may only be apparent at the level of the native Env complex.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14990699</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.78.6.2790-2807.2004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/78/6/2790</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, additional phenotypic characteristics are necessary for HIV-1 neurotropism. Furthermore, neurotropic strains are not necessarily neurovirulent. To better understand the determinants of HIV-1 neurovirulence, we isolated viruses from brain tissue samples from three AIDS patients with dementia and HIV-1 encephalitis and analyzed their ability to induce syncytia in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and neuronal apoptosis in primary brain cultures. Two R5X4 viruses (MACS1-br and MACS1-spln) were highly fusogenic in MDM and induced neuronal apoptosis. The R5 viruses UK1-br and MACS2-br are both neurotropic. However, only UK1-br induced high levels of fusion in MDM and neuronal apoptosis. Full-length Env clones from UK1-br required lower CCR5 and CD4 levels than Env clones from MACS2-br to function efficiently in cell-to-cell fusion and single-round infection assays. UK1-br Envs also had a greater affinity for CCR5 than MACS2-br Envs in binding assays. Relatively high levels of UK1-br and MACS2-br Envs bound to CCR5 in the absence of soluble CD4. However, these Envs could not mediate CD4-independent infection, and MACS2-br Envs were unable to mediate fusion or infection in cells expressing low levels of CD4. The UK1-br virus was more resistant than MACS2-br to inhibition by the CCR5-targeted inhibitors TAK-779 and Sch-C.

In other individuals, only CC chemokine receptor 5–using (R5), non-SI (NSI) virus variants are present throughout infection. These individuals may be either long-term survivors (LTSs) or rapid progressors. The basis for this variable disease progression in individuals with only R5 virus variants is not yet fully understood. In this study, the β-chemokine sensitivity of biological HIV-1 clones isolated from 13 individuals who harbored only R5, NSI virus variants (7 LTSs and 6 progressors) was investigated. We found a statistically significant decrease in sensitivity of virus variants to RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell–expressed and –secreted) neutralization during the course of progressive infection, but not during follow-up of LTSs.

In the present study, we generated envelope glycoproteins comprising chimeric V3 loops and/or V3 loops with deletions and studied their binding to CCR5 amino-terminal domain (Nt)-based sulfopeptides and cell surface CCR5, as well as their ability to mediate viral entry. We thus delineated two functionally distinct domains of the V3 loop, the V3 stem and the V3 crown. The V3 stem alone mediates soluble gp120 binding to the CCR5 Nt. In contrast, both the V3 stem and crown are required for soluble gp120 binding to cell surface CCR5. Within the context of a virion, however, the V3 crown alone determines coreceptor usage.

The capacity of HIV to develop drug resistance mutations is a major obstacle to long-term effective anti-HIV therapy. Incomplete suppression of viral replication with an initial drug regimen diminishes the clinical benefit to the patient and may promote the development of broader drug resistance that may cause subsequent treatment regimens to be ineffective. The increased clinical use of combination antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection has led to the selection of viral strains resistant to multiple drugs, including strains resistant to all licensed nucleoside analog RT inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Therefore, it is important to understand the influence of such mutations on viral properties such as replicative fitness, fidelity, and mutation rates. Although research continues to improve our understanding of resistance, leading to refined treatment strategies and, in some cases, improved outcome, resistance to antiretroviral therapy remains a major cause of treatment failure among patients living with HIV-1.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1111/j.1472-8206.2011.01009.x</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-8206.2011.01009.x/abstract</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Enfuvirtide (ENF), licensed in 2002, is the first marketed antiretroviral (ARV) agent that targets viral entry. ENF blocks the virus replication cycle by binding to gp41, a critical component of the machinery used by HIV to enter host cells. As with all ARVs, HIV can evolve resistance to ENF. However, resistance to ENF appears to be somewhat more complex and can derive through either direct or indirect pathways. Direct resistance occurs when mutations in the first heptad repeat of gp41, which constitutes the ENF-binding site, reduce ENF binding. Indirect resistance is not attributable to changes in the ENF-binding site per se, but rather to changes in the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp120) that reduce ENF susceptibility by more complex mechanisms. The extensive gp120 amino-acid sequence heterogeneity found in primary viral isolates results in unusually broad variability in susceptibility to ENF, and indeed to other classes of HIV entry inhibitors. Clinical data reported to date do not provide clear evidence that virological outcome of ENF therapy can be predicted by either genotypic or phenotypic analysis of viruses present in patients at initiation of ENF therapy. Although ENF offers an exciting opportunity to treat multi-drug resistant HIV, these observations suggest a greater understanding of ENF resistance may be required to ensure the most effective use of ENF in infected patients. Many aspects of the complexities observed in ENF resistance are likely to be relevant for other classes of HIV entry inhibitors currently in development.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.drup.2004.03.003</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368764604000263</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

NRTIs are deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, but lack a free 3′-hydroxyl group. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the nascent viral DNA, in reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), further viral DNA synthesis is effectively terminated. NRTIs should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, HIV-1 inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in RT. To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for HIV-1 RT resistance to NRTIs. These mechanisms include alterations of RT discrimination between NRTIs and the analogous dNTP (direct effects on NRTI binding and/or incorporation), alterations in RT-template/primer interactions, which may influence subsequent NRTI incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in RT. This review discusses the relationship between HIV-1 drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of HIV-1 RT structure.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1007/PL00000626</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00000626</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Wild, T. Greenwell, and T. Matthews, AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 9:1051–1053, 1993). In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of this peptide, we derived resistant variants of HIV-1IIIB and NL4-3 by serial virus passage in the presence of increasing doses of the peptide. Sequence analysis of the resistant isolates suggested that a contiguous 3-amino-acid sequence within the amino-terminal heptad repeat motif of gp41 was associated with resistance. Site-directed mutagenesis studies confirmed this observation and indicated that changes in two of these three residues were necessary for development of the resistant phenotype. Direct binding of DP178 to recombinant protein and synthetic peptide analogs containing the wild-type and mutant heptad repeat sequences revealed a strong correlation between DP178 binding and the biological sensitivity of the corresponding virus isolates to DP178.

T-20 inhibits a conformational change in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) that is required for fusion between HIV-1 and target cell membranes. The initial phase I clinical trial of T-20 treatment for HIV-infected patients thus provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the emergence of resistant virus in vivo to this novel class of antiretroviral agents. All four patients who received an intermediate dose of T-20 (30 mg twice daily) had an initial decline in plasma viral load over the first 10 days but a rising trend by day 14, suggestive of selection for resistant virus. Plasma virus derived from patients enrolled in all dosage groups of the phase I T-20 trial was analyzed by population sequencing before and after treatment. While no mutations were found within a highly conserved 3-amino-acid sequence (GIV) known to be critical for fusion at baseline, after 14 days of therapy, virus from one patient in the 30-mg dose group (30-1) developed a mutation in this motif, specifically an aspartic acid (D) substitution for glycine (G) at position 36. Multiple env clones were derived from the plasma virus of all four patients in the 30-mg dosage group. Sequence analysis of 49 clones derived from the plasma of patient 30-1 on day 14 revealed that 25 clones contained the G36D mutation, while 8 contained the V38A mutation. Dual mutations involving G36D and other residues within the HR1 domain were also identified. In 5 of the 49 env clones, other mutations involving residues 32 (Q32R or Q32H) and 39 (Q39R) were found in combination with G36D. Cloned env sequences derived from the plasma virus of subject 30-3 also had single mutations in the GIV sequence (V38M and I37V) detectable following therapy with T-20. The plasma virus from subjects 30-2 and 30-4 did not contain changes within the GIV sequence. To analyze the biological resistance properties of these mutations, we developed a novel single-cycle HIV-1 entry assay using JC53BL cells which express β-galactosidase and luciferase under control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Full-length env clones were derived from the plasma virus of patients 30-1 and 30-3 and used to generate pseudotyped virus stocks. The mean 50\% inhibition concentrations (IC50s) for mutants G36D and V38A (patient 30-1) were 2.3 μg/ml and 11.2 μg/ml, respectively, statistically significant increases of 9.1- and 45-fold, respectively, compared with those of wild-type Env. The IC50 for the V38 M mutation (patient 30-3) was 7.6 μg/ml, an 8-fold increase compared with that of the wild type. The I37V mutation resulted in an IC50 3.2-fold greater than that of the wild type. Envs with double mutations (Q32R plus G36D and Q32H plus G36D) exhibited a level of resistance similar to that of G36D alone. These findings provide the first evidence for the rapid emergence of clinical resistance to a novel class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors and may be relevant to future treatment strategies involving these agents.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12019106</NOTES><URL>10.1128/AAC.46.6.1896-1905.2002</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://aac.asm.org/content/46/6/1896</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

T-20 binds the first helical region (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) protein and prevents conformational changes required for membrane fusion. HR1 appears to become accessible to T-20 after Env binds CD4, whereas coreceptor binding is thought to induce the final conformational changes that lead to membrane fusion. Thus, T-20 binds to a structural intermediate of the fusion process. Primary viruses exhibit considerable variability in T-20 sensitivity, and determinants outside of HR1 can affect sensitivity by unknown mechanisms. We studied chimeric Env proteins containing different V3 loop sequences and found that gp120/coreceptor affinity correlated with T-20 and coreceptor antagonist sensitivity, with greater affinity resulting in increased resistance to both classes of entry inhibitors. Enhanced affinity resulted in more rapid fusion kinetics, reducing the time during which Env is sensitive to T-20. Reduced coreceptor expression levels also delayed fusion kinetics and enhanced virus sensitivity to T-20, whereas increased coreceptor levels had the opposite effect. A single amino acid change (K421D) in the bridging sheet region of the primary virus strain YU2 reduced affinity for CCR5 and increased T-20 sensitivity by about 30-fold. Thus, mutations in Env that affect receptor engagement and membrane fusion rates can alter entry inhibitor sensitivity. Because coreceptor expression levels are typically limiting in vivo, individuals who express lower coreceptor levels may respond more favorably to entry inhibitors such as T-20, whose effectiveness we show depends in part on fusion kinetics.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12444251</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.252469399</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/99/25/16249</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

These reconstructions revealed that while the structures and positions of the conical cores within each VLP were unique, they exhibited several surprisingly consistent features, including similarities in the size and shape of the wide end of the capsid (the “base”), uniform positioning of the base and other regions of the capsid 11 nm away from the envelope/MA layer, a cone angle that typically varied from 24° to 18° around the long axis of the cone, and an internal density (presumably part of the NC/RNA complex) cupped within the base. Multiple and nested capsids were observed. These results support the fullerene cone model for the viral capsid, indicate that viral maturation involves a free re-organization of the capsid shell rather than a continuous condensation, imply that capsid assembly is both concentration-driven and template-driven, suggest that specific interactions exist between the capsid and the adjacent envelope/MA and NC/RNA layers, and show that a particular capsid shape is favored strongly in-vivo.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.jmb.2004.11.064</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604015359</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The crystal structure of chemically synthesized HIV-1 protease has been determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution (R factor of 0.184) with the use of a model based on the Rous sarcoma virus protease structure. In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2548279</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.2548279</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/245/4918/616</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here, we report the in vitro selection of viral variants with decreased sensitivity to a C2-symmetric protease inhibitor (A-77003). We show that a single amino acid substitution (Arg to Gln or Lys) at position 8 of the protease results in a substantial decrease in the inhibitory activity of the drug on the enzyme and a comparable increase in viral resistance. These findings, when analyzed by using the three-dimensional structure of the protease-drug complex, provide a strategic guide for the future development of inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8107264</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/68/3/2016</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

These studies included nine clinical trials and three observational cohorts. The primary end-point in our analyses was virological failure by week 24. Baseline factors that were investigated as predictors of virological failure were plasma HIV-1 RNA, the number and type of new antiretroviral drugs in the regimen, and viral susceptibility to the drugs in the regimen, determined by genotyping or phenotyping methods. These analyses confirmed the importance of both genotypic and phenotypic drug resistance as predictors of virological failure, whether these factors were analysed separately or adjusted for other baseline confounding factors. In most of the re-analysed studies, the odds of virological failure were reduced by about twofold for each additional drug in the regimen to which the patient's virus was sensitive by genotyping methods, and by about two- to threefold for each additional drug that was sensitive by phenotyping.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10846592</NOTES></RECORD>

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90 (1993) 6320]. This report reviews the structure of the reverse transcriptase heterodimer and provides a detailed description of the folding and topology of the individual subdomains. The interactions of the enzyme with bound template- primer are highlighted. Structure-function relationships have been established and are discussed for several conserved sequence motifs located within the enzyme. Each of these motifs is found to interact significantly with template-primer during the polymerization process. This review integrates the findings of both structure determinations, in particular, to relate these structures to strategies for drug design and development. The structures of both the nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitor binding sites are described, and the spatial relationship between the two sites is discussed in light of some novel possibilities for drug development. The first indication of an HIV-1 RT drug-resistant mutation manifested in the p51 subunit is presented. This mutation is located in a region of p51 that is proximal to the nonnucleoside binding pocket. The mechanisms of HIV-1 RT inhibition by both nucleoside and nonnucleoside classes of inhibitors are discussed in relation to the structure of the enzyme. In addition, the implications of the structure for understanding and avoiding the development of resistance of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to antiviral inhibitors are discussed.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1007/BF02171659</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02171659</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The goal of the current treatment strategies is to inhibit the viral replication as completely as possible by using a combination of 3 or more antiretroviral drugs. This Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has radically changed the clinical outcome of HIV, leading to decreased mortality and morbidity, at least in developed countries. Additionally to the advent of new and potent drugs, demonstrations of the prognostic value of the CD4 cell count and the plasma viral load were of major importance in the development of therapeutic strategies. Especially the ability of viral load assays to assess accurately the true level of viral replication, led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. HIV proved to be a highly dynamic infection even during the period of clinical latency. The initial enthusiasm that HAART could radically change the outcome of HIV was cooled off in face of the difficulties in real life associated with the complex treatment strategies. Besides long-term side effects and suboptimal drug potency, the emergence of resistant virus and the necessity of perfect therapy adherence are major concerns for obtaining a sustained control of viral replication. In this study we focused on HIV resistance, which remains one of the major threats for a sustained response to antiretroviral therapy. HIV proved to be able to develop resistance to all currently used antiretroviral drugs. The high replication rate of the virus together with the low fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase, from the basis for the presence of enormous amounts of viral variants. Whenever viral replication is ongoing in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, these variants that escape the inhibitory effects of the drugs will be selected. Although the knowledge in the field of HIV resistance has expanded enormously, many issues need to be answered. Genotypic and phenotypic resistance patterns are evolving continuously, due to changes in the treatment strategies. Moreover the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure needs further investigation, in order to prove the relevance of performing resistance testing in the follow-up of HIV-infected patients. The wide availability of antiretroviral drugs has led to the transmission of resistant HIV. Infection with HIV resistant to one or more antiretroviral drugs has been observed to occur through the different transmission routes. In a first study we assessed the prevalence of genotypic resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Belgian antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. We observed that HIV strains with resistance-related mutations to one or more classes of antiretroviral drugs are not uncommon in the Belgian naïve patients. Furthermore the inclusion of samples from patients visiting the Belgian hospitals for the first time in 1995, 1997 and 1998, showed that the overall prevalence of baseline genotypic resistance remains rather constant (26-30\%). The increasing trend in genotypic baseline resistance to 3TC (2\% to 6.3\%) and PIs (4.4\% to 9.9\%) as well as the decrease in ZDV-resistance (13.3\% to 5.4\%), reflect the change in treatment strategies, and resistance to these drugs is most probably caused by transmission of variants with resistance mutations selected during therapy. The presence of NNRTI-related mutations (around 16\%) is likely to reflect the occurrence of baseline polymorphisms, since NNRTI-related mutations can occur without a replication deficit for the virus. Moreover, despite the rather recent introduction of NNRTIs into the clinic from 1997 onwards, no clear trend in NNRTI baseline resistance over time is observed. The best current therapeutic strategy for HIV-infected patients is to start antiretroviral therapy with HAART in order to avoid the accumulation of resistance towards drugs in less suppressive regimens. In a second study, we showed that the start of HAART in antiretroviral-naive HIV-patients in daily clinical practice could prevent viral breakthrough for up to 44 months in 60\% of patients (n = 25). Six of 10 patients with virologic failure developed resistance to the drugs included in their treatment regimens. In comparison to patients with a sustained virologic response, patients with virologic failure were in a later disease stage when starting therapy and showed lower PI drug-levels, what can be an indication of poor adherence. Despite a poor virologic response for some of them, a rise in CD4 cell count was observed for all patients during the study period. A large number of HIV-infected patients started treatment in the pre-HAART period. The use of NRTIs is mono- or bitherapy was not able to prevent the development of resistant virus. In a third study we studied the prevalence and characteristics of 2 patterns of multinucleoside resistance (MNR) in European patients (n = 755). In patients without NRTI-exposure or with exposure to only one NRTI, no MNR was observed. MNR was present in low prevalence (each pattern \textless 2\%) in patients pretreated with multiple NRTIs. Despite this low prevalence, MNR should be closely monitored, since it results in broad cross-resistance to NRTIs in vitro and a poor therapy response in vivo. We also assessed the predictive value of baseline resistance on the virologic response to later added drugs. The genotype of patients starting or changing a therapy consisting solely of NRTIs was analyzed at baseline and 6 months later. In patients without genotypic mutations towards the added drug the virologic response was significantly better compared to patients with baseline resistance. At 6 months however, both patient groups showed a rise in viral load due to the accumulation of NRTI-related mutations under the presence of poorly suppressive regimens, although the difference between the two groups remained significant. In this study, and also in studies reported by others, the presence of baseline resistance has a high predictive value for therapy failure, while the absence of resistance is not predictive for therapy response. Suboptimal adherence may be one of the reasons of the poor predictive value of the absence of baseline resistance for a good therapy response. In a last observational study, we investigated the relation between adherence, the presence and development of genotypic resistance and the virologic response in patients during HAART therapy. Adherence to 1 protease inhibitor was monitored using Electronic Event Monitoring. Patients with perfect therapy adherence and in particular without drug holidays, can control viral replication provided that the activity of the drugs included in the combination is not entirely compromised by the presence of baseline resistance mutations. In our patient population, reduced adherence resulted in therapy failure, mostly associated with a subsequent accumulation of resistance mutations. In conclusion, the outcome of the HIV disease has been revolutionarily changed with the advent of HAART. Both resistance and treatment adherence are crucial factors in determining the therapy response. Retrospective studies, such as ours, and a limited number of prospective trials already proved the short-term benefit of therapy switch based on the results of resistance tests in addition to standard of care. To ultimately define the role of tools as resistance testing and adherence monitoring with eventual adherence interventions, more prospective trials are needed as well in treatment-naïve as in experienced patients.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11813503</NOTES></RECORD>

The recent identification of the elusive host cell factor let loose a flood of advances. These findings have revealed a novel innate defense mechanism against retroviruses. In infected cells, the cellular cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, a relative of the activation-induced deaminase (AID), is encapsidated into assembling virions. The enzyme lies in the virion, waiting to wreak havoc on the viral genome in the next round of virus replication – unless it is first caught by Vif.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.coi.2004.05.006</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791504000755</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The presence of a dideoxynucleotide at the 3′-primer terminus allows capture of a state in which the substrates are poised for attack on the dNTP. Conformational changes that accompany formation of the catalytic complex produce distinct clusters of the residues that are altered in viruses resistant to nucleoside analog drugs. The positioning of these residues in the neighborhood of the dNTP helps to resolve some long-standing puzzles about the molecular basis of resistance. The resistance mutations are likely to influence binding or reactivity of the inhibitors, relative to normal dNTPs, and the clustering of the mutations correlates with the chemical structure of the drug.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9831551</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.282.5394.1669</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5394/1669</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

NMR experiments show that the protein folds into two distinct domains, a transmembrane hydrophobic helix and a cytoplasmic domain with two in-plane amphipathic α-helices separated by a linker region. Resonances in one-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra of uniformly 15N labeled Vpu are clearly segregated into two bands at chemical shift frequencies associated with NH bonds in a transmembrane α-helix, perpendicular to the membrane surface, and with NH bonds in the cytoplasmic helices parallel to the membrane surface. Solid-state NMR spectra of truncated Vpu2–51 (residues 2–51), which contains the transmembrane α-helix and the first amphipathic helix of the cytoplasmic domain, and of a construct Vpu28–81 (residues 28–81), which contains only the cytoplasmic domain, support this structural model of Vpu in the membrane. Full-length Vpu (residues 2–81) forms discrete ion-conducting channels of heterogeneous conductance in lipid bilayers. The most frequent conductances were 22 ± 3 pS and 12 ± 3 pS in 0.5 M KCl and 29 ± 3 pS and 12 ± 3 pS in 0.5 M NaCl. In agreement with the structural model, truncated Vpu2–51, which has the transmembrane helix, forms discrete channels in lipid bilayers, whereas the cytoplasmic domain Vpu28–81, which lacks the transmembrane helix, does not. This finding shows that the channel activity is associated with the transmembrane helical domain. The pattern of channel activity is characteristic of the self-assembly of conductive oligomers in the membrane and is compatible with the structural and functional findings.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10588706</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.96.25.14336</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/96/25/14336</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Basic science research, clinical trial results, and expert opinions were used to form the basis of this report. Data on methods for and characteristics of specific genotypic and phenotypic assays were obtained from manufacturers and service providers.Consensus Process.—  The panel met regularly between October 1997 and April 1998. Panel subgroups developed and discussed different sections of the report before discussing them with the entire panel. Conclusions and suggested approaches to the use of resistance testing were determined by group consensus.Conclusions.—  Plasma HIV RNA level and CD4+ cell count are the primary values that should be used to guide the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and subsequent changes in therapy. Possible causes of treatment failure other than development of drug resistance that should be considered are adherence, drug potency, and pharmacokinetic issues. Genotypic and phenotypic testing for HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs may prove useful for individual patient management. Assays under development need validation, standardization, and a clearer definition of their clinical roles. Possible current roles of resistance testing for choosing an initial regimen or changing antiretroviral therapy, as well as possible implications of the presence or absence of phenotypic resistance and genotypic changes, are discussed.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1001/jama.279.24.1984</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.279.24.1984</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

DESIGN: Prospective, tertiary care centre-based study. PATIENTS: One-hundred-and-forty-five HIV-infected adults on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) for \textgreater6 months experiencing virological failure. METHODS: The physicians' decision-making process when choosing a salvage regimen was prospectively documented: at time of virological failure, on 'failing ART', genotyping was performed and a hypothetical 'clinical expert ART' based upon patient's drug history was documented. Subsequently, data on resistance mutations, rating by a decision support software and drug history were used to define 'genotyping ART'. After discussion with the patient, final treatment, 'new personalized ART' was chosen and prescribed. To compare the relative potency of the four ART regimens in a standardized manner, a resistance score ranging from 1 (best) to 8 (worst) based on drug ranking by decision support software was attributed to each ART regimen. Virological and immunological outcomes were analysed based on the magnitude of the resistance score. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 1.5 years. In all 145 patients, median resistance scores for the stepwise selected ART regimens were: 'failing ART': 4.5, 'clinical expert ART': 1.8, 'genotyping ART': 1.5 and 'new personalized ART': 2. The latter was 1.5 in patients who effectively switched to 'new personalized ART' (n=89). Lower resistance scores translated into significantly improved virological response after initiation of 'new personalized ART'. In multivariable analysis, lower resistance scores, lower baseline HIV RNA levels and use of novel antiretroviral drugs were associated with the probability of reducing plasma viraemia to \textless50 copies/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that treatment choices including genotype and decision support software were virologically superior to those based on drug history only.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14640392</NOTES></RECORD>

Supplementum</SECONDARY_TITLE><VOLUME>106</VOLUME><PAGES>66-70</PAGES><ISBN>0300-8878</ISBN><LABEL>narciso_genotypic_2003</LABEL><ABSTRACT>Witness for the prosecution: Assays to detect antiretroviral drug resistance have recently become available, but several factors limit the clinical utility of resistance testing in patients with primary HIV infection (PHI). First, there is a great uncertainty in the prevalence of PHI due to resistant virus, which may vary from 2\% to over 50\%. Moreover, studies on temporal trends give discordant results. Secondly, the reported degree of resistance is also variable since low levels of resistance are reported in some cases. The clinical significance of such low-level baseline reduced susceptibility to some antiretrovirals is uncertain. Thirdly, current resistance testing might not detect minority populations of drug-resistant species. Reversion of mutations conferring drug resistance was described in patients who acquired drug-resistant strains, and viral strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations may become minor species in untreated patients owing to the absence of drug pressure. Finally, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to test the clinical or virological utility of resistance testing in PHI. Witness for the defence: A suboptimal initial regimen in subjects infected with drug-resistant virus may be associated with multiple treatment failures in the early stage of the disease and hence with a more rapid disease progression. When treating PHI, immediate, complete and long-lasting suppression of virus replication is desired both to limit total body viral burden and to preserve HIV-1 specific immune responses. Transmission of resistant virus has been identified for each therapeutic class. A greater than 2.5-fold resistance to one or more antiretroviral agent has been observed in 26\% of patients with PHI and resistance among newly infected patients has increased over the past 3 y. Treatment should not be delayed to wait for the result of the test. However, once a resistant virus has been identified, one or more drugs can be readily substituted. Prospective randomized studies to address the need for baseline resistance testing in the setting of PHI are warranted.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15000588</NOTES></RECORD>

To identify the predictive factors of virological failure in patients with antiretroviral (ARV) salvage therapy. METHODS: Observational study in HIV-infected patients for whom GRT was requested for virological failure (VF) in the period of 1 October 1999 to 31 December 2001. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictive factors of virological progression. RESULTS: Over the period studied, 196 patients required GRT for VF (15\%) among those monitored in specific units. GRT was mainly requested for patients who had been extensively pretreated for a mean of 5 years and with a median of 5 ARV combinations. Half the patients presented 3 or more mutations associated with thymidine analogs (TAMs), mutations associated with non-nucleoside analogs (NNRTIs), and 5 or more mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PIs). In 143 (74\%) patients, the RTV regimen was changed on the basis of GRT results. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the percentage of patients with plasma VL \textless 400 cop/mL at 6, 12 and 18 months was 41\%, 29\% and 17\%, respectively. In the on-treatment analysis, the results were 50\%, 48\% and 46\%, respectively. Mean CD4 lymphocyte increase was 59.74 and 94 cells/mm 3. The variables predicting virological failure (plasma VL \textgreater 400 cop/mL) at 12 months were plasma VL \textgreater 30,000 cop/mL (OR 6, 1.8-19.5) and accumulation of 3 or more TAMs (OR 4.4, 1.3-15) at the start of ARV salvage therapy. CONCLUSION: Even though in clinical practice GRT is requested for patients with various treatment failures, when ART salvage treatment was started, plasma VL was undetectable and immunological response persisted in 40\% of patients followed-up for 18 months. The factors best predicting virological evolution were VL and the number of baseline TAMs.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16725081</NOTES></RECORD>

METHODS: The Narval trial was designed to compare phenotyping, genotyping and standard of care for the choice of antiretroviral therapy in patients in whom a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen had failed. Virological success was defined as viral load below 200 copies/ml at week 12. Baseline variables including demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, HIV reverse transcriptase and protease mutations, the randomization arm, the drugs prescribed, as well as adherence to treatment and plasma concentrations of PIs and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) at week 12 were tested in the model. Variables that were significantly associated with virological success in univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Five-hundred-and-forty-one patients were randomized. Virological success at week 12 was obtained in 200 patients. In multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with virological success: prescription of efavirenz to NNRTI-naive patients (OR=4.37; 95\% CI: 2.76-6.90), randomization to the genotyping arm (OR=2.13, 1.20-3.79), prescription of lamivudine (OR=1.69, 1.01-2.83) and prescription of abacavir to abacavir-naive patients (OR=1.66, 1.02-2.72). Factors significantly associated with virological failure were prescription of nelfinavir (OR=0.30, 0.13-0.68), a high baseline viral load (OR=0.37, 0.28-0.50), the presence of at least five PI mutations (OR=0.42, 0.26-0.66), the presence of at least three thymidine analogue mutations (OR=0.61, 0.39-0.97) and at least 30 months of prior PI exposure (OR=0.64, 0.41-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that among heavily pretreated patients, prescription of efavirenz to NNRTI-naive patients is associated with a good virological response, while a high baseline viral load, a large number of PI mutations and nelfinavir prescription at baseline are associated with a poor virological response. Genotyping was found to be beneficial, while this was not the case for phenotyping.

HIV-1 employs a multitude of schemes to generate variants: accumulation of base substitutions, insertions and deletions, addition and loss of glycosylation sites in the envelope protein, and recombination. A comparison between HIV and influenza virus illustrates the extraordinary scale of HIV variation, and underscores the importance of exploring innovative HIV vaccine strategies. Deeper understanding of the implications of variation for both antibody and T-cell responses may help in the effort to rationally design vaccines that stimulate broad cross-reactivity.

Despite the availability of numerous antivirals, many extensively treated patients gradually loose the ability to control viral replication because of development of antiviral resistance. Laboratory tests have been developed and validated to assist in recognizing such resistance and to help predict which antivirals may be more likely to control viral replication in a given patient. Both genotypic and phenotypic assays have been developed to assess HIV-1 antiviral resistance. The assay methodologies, including the advantages and disadvantages of each method, as well as the limitations of each method are reviewed. The ability to predict likely drug response from a genotype or a phenotype is continually evolving, and the more recently discovered mutation/drug resistance associations are discussed in terms of their implications for HIV resistance assays. To provide additional options for those who have developed resistance to all currently available drugs, new antivirals, such as the fusion inhibitors, are being developed. These new classes of antivirals block the HIV viral life cycle at sites other than reverse transcriptase and protease. Unique and novel resistance assays are being developed to measure HIV resistance to these new drugs. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The use of genotypic-resistance analysis to assist therapeutic decision-making in patients failing therapy has not been investigated. We assessed the virological and immunological impact of genotypic-resistance testing. Methods We did a prospective, open, randomised, controlled study of HIV-1-infected patients in whom combination therapy was not successful. We randomly assigned patients standard care (control, n=43) or treatment according to the resistance mutations in protease and reverse-transcriptase genes (genotypic group, n=65). The major endpoint was the change in HIV-1 RNA viral load. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings 108 patients were enrolled. All patients were similar for risk factors, age, sex, previous treatment, CD4-cell count (214/fxL [SD14]) and log HIV-1 RNA viral load at baseline (4–7 copies/ml [0–1]). At month 3, the mean change in HIV-1 RNA was -1-04 log (0–14) in the study group compared with −0–46 log (0–17) in the control group (mean difference 0–58 log [95\% Cl 0-14-1-02], p=0–01). At month 6, changes were −1–15 (0–15) log copies/mL, and −0-67 (0–19) log copies/mL in the genotypic group and the control group, respectively (mean difference 0–48 log [0-01-0-97], p=0-05). Difference in the drop in viral load combined at 3 months and 6 months was significant (p=0-015). At month 3, HIV-1 RNA was lower than detection level (200 copies/mL) in 29\% (19/65) of patients in the genotypic group versus 14\% (6/43) in the control group (p=0-017). At month 6, the values were 32\% (21/65) and 14\% (6/43) (p=0-067) for the genotypic group and the control group, respectively. Therapy was generally well tolerated, with ten patients (six in the genotypic group, four in the control group) requiring toxic-effect-related drug modification. Interpretation We found genotypic-resistance testing to have a significant benefit on the virological response when choosing a therapeutic alternative.

This study compares the ability of the most commonly used systems (ANRS, Rega, and Stanford's HIVdb) to predict virological outcome at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. Methodology/Principal Findings Included were 3763 treatment-change episodes (TCEs) for which a HIV-1 genotype was available at the time of changing treatment with at least one follow-up viral load measurement. Genotypic susceptibility scores for the active regimens were calculated using scores defined by each interpretation system. Using logistic regression, we determined the association between the genotypic susceptibility score and proportion of TCEs having an undetectable viral load (\textless50 copies/ml) at 12 (8–16) weeks (2152 TCEs), 24 (16–32) weeks (2570 TCEs), and 48 (44–52) weeks (1083 TCEs). The Area under the ROC curve was calculated using a 10-fold cross-validation to compare the different interpretation systems regarding the sensitivity and specificity for predicting undetectable viral load. The mean genotypic susceptibility score of the systems was slightly smaller for HIVdb, with 1.92±1.17, compared to Rega and ANRS, with 2.22±1.09 and 2.23±1.05, respectively. However, similar odds ratio's were found for the association between each-unit increase in genotypic susceptibility score and undetectable viral load at week 12; 1.6 [95\% confidence interval 1.5–1.7] for HIVdb, 1.7 [1.5–1.8] for ANRS, and 1.7 [1.9–1.6] for Rega. Odds ratio's increased over time, but remained comparable (odds ratio's ranging between 1.9–2.1 at 24 weeks and 1.9–2.2 at 48 weeks). The Area under the curve of the ROC did not differ between the systems at all time points; p = 0.60 at week 12, p = 0.71 at week 24, and p = 0.97 at week 48. Conclusions/Significance Three commonly used HIV drug resistance interpretation systems ANRS, Rega and HIVdb predict virological response at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, after change of treatment to the same extent.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pone.0011505</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0011505</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

HIV-1 group O strains are spontaneously resistant to non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and little is known about the antiretroviral (ARV) drug susceptibility of nBS clinical isolates. Controlled randomized trials showing a clinical benefit of a treatment guided by HIV-1 resistance testing at virological failure have been conducted on subtype B. Thus, the result cannot be simply extended to nBS. In nBS, the frequency or amplification failure is increased, but retesting failed samples with an alternative set of polymerase chain reaction primers improves the success of amplification. The major problem is the reliability of genotypic resistance tests (GRT) owing to misinterpretation of the obtained amino acid mutations, the background sequence in nBS being different from the standard used in the commercial kits or in the web-based HIV-1 resistance interpretation tools. At the moment, no nBS database is available to help in the interpretation of the protease and RT sequence results. Furthermore, the mutational pattern of specific ARV drugs may be different, in particular with subtype C and G. In conclusion, in patients with nBS the indication to for at virological failure may exists, even in the absence of clinical evidence, but the results have to be interpreted by experts with particular caution. Witness for the defence: The extensive variability of HIV-1 has a potential impact on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy and the prevention of infection. Nine different major subtypes of group M (A-D, F-H, J and K) circulate to varying extents in populations around the globe together with the circulating recombinant forms (CRF) owing to intersubtype recombinations. Although viruses belonging to the HIV-1 B clade are still predominant in Europe, the USA and Australia, an increasing prevalence of non-clade B subtypes and CRF has been reported by several surveys in previously homogeneous clade B countries. As current ARV have been designed using subtype B strains and resistance mutations have been characterized on this subtype, the increasing global spread of HIV subtypes highlights the need to determine the activity of anti-HIV drugs against subtypes or CRF other than subtype B.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15000590</NOTES></RECORD>

Whether this intrapatient accumulation of escape mutations translates into HIV evolution at the population level has not been evaluated. We studied over 300 patients drawn from the B- and C-clade epidemics, focusing on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles HLA-B57 and HLA-B5801, which are associated with long-term HIV control and are therefore likely to exert strong selection pressure on the virus. The CTL response dominating acute infection in HLA-B57/5801-positive subjects drove positive selection of an escape mutation that reverted to wild-type after transmission to HLA-B57/5801-negative individuals. A second escape mutation within the epitope, by contrast, was maintained after transmission. These data show that the process of accumulation of escape mutations within HIV is not inevitable. Complex epitope- and residue-specific selection forces, including CTL-mediated positive selection pressure and virus-mediated purifying selection, operate in tandem to shape HIV evolution at the population level.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nm992</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nm/journal/v10/n3/abs/nm992.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether drug selection (PI versus NNRTI) in antiretroviral-naive patients is related to virological response at 6 months within a clinical cohort. DESIGN: Databases from two large clinics were used to identify all treatment-naive patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (PI/ two PI or NNRTI). Statistical models determined the likelihood of suppressing HIV viral load \textless 500 copies/ml, the risk of treatment failure by 6 months, and factors associated with treatment success. RESULTS: Of 1109 potentially eligible patients 888 met study criteria and were included; 484 were prescribed a PI (40\% indinavir, 41\% nelfinavir) and 404 were prescribed NNRTI (40\% efavirenz, 60\% nevirapine). Three treatment arms were compared: efavirenz versus nevirapine versus PI. After stratification by year and centre and adjustment for baseline variables, only treatment group and baseline viral load remained significantly associated with virological suppression at 6 months. Patients on efavirenz were significantly more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load than those on PI or nevirapine. The relative hazard for nevirapine was 0.77 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.96, P = 0.02) and that for PI was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.58-0.94, P = 0.01). Efavirenz also performed better in the analysis of treatment failure at 6 months. CONCLUSION: Although observational cohort data may be susceptible to significant bias, this study suggests a better initial virological response for efavirenz compared to either nevirapine or the PI. Clinical trial data is required to confirm these findings.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11741163</NOTES></RECORD>

The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility.

Here we describe a scalable, highly parallel sequencing system with raw throughput significantly greater than that of state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis instruments. The apparatus uses a novel fibre-optic slide of individual wells and is able to sequence 25 million bases, at 99\% or better accuracy, in one four-hour run. To achieve an approximately 100-fold increase in throughput over current Sanger sequencing technology, we have developed an emulsion method for DNA amplification and an instrument for sequencing by synthesis using a pyrosequencing protocol optimized for solid support and picolitre-scale volumes.

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from \textgreater30× average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nature07517</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v456/n7218/full/nature07517.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36× coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19420381</NOTES><URL>10.1101/gr.088013.108</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1124</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here we describe a DNA sequencing technology in which scalable, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing techniques are used to make an integrated circuit able to directly perform non-optical DNA sequencing of genomes. Sequence data are obtained by directly sensing the ions produced by template-directed DNA polymerase synthesis using all-natural nucleotides on this massively parallel semiconductor-sensing device or ion chip. The ion chip contains ion-sensitive, field-effect transistor-based sensors in perfect register with 1.2 million wells, which provide confinement and allow parallel, simultaneous detection of independent sequencing reactions. Use of the most widely used technology for constructing integrated circuits, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, allows for low-cost, large-scale production and scaling of the device to higher densities and larger array sizes. We show the performance of the system by sequencing three bacterial genomes, its robustness and scalability by producing ion chips with up to 10 times as many sensors and sequencing a human genome.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nature10242</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v475/n7356/full/nature10242.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Our method uses the longest reads as seeds to recruit all other reads for construction of highly accurate preassembled reads through a directed acyclic graph–based consensus procedure, which we follow with assembly using off-the-shelf long-read assemblers. In contrast to hybrid approaches, HGAP does not require highly accurate raw reads for error correction. We demonstrate efficient genome assembly for several microorganisms using as few as three SMRT Cell zero-mode waveguide arrays of sequencing and for BACs using just one SMRT Cell. Long repeat regions can be successfully resolved with this workflow. We also describe a consensus algorithm that incorporates SMRT sequencing primary quality values to produce de novo genome sequence exceeding 99.999\% accuracy.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nmeth.2474</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/full/nmeth.2474.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here we describe a method that can quantify such variation at a scale and ease heretofore unattainable. Each DNA molecule in a collection of such molecules is converted into a single magnetic particle to which thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to the original are bound. This population of beads then corresponds to a one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules. Variation within the original population of DNA molecules can then be simply assessed by counting fluorescently labeled particles via flow cytometry. This approach is called BEAMing on the basis of four of its principal components (beads, emulsion, amplification, and magnetics). Millions of individual DNA molecules can be assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment. Moreover, specific variants can be isolated by flow sorting and used for further experimentation. BEAMing can be used for the identification and quantification of rare mutations as well as to study variations in gene sequences or transcripts in specific populations or tissues.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 12857956</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.1133470100</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/100/15/8817</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Each method was first evaluated for its capacity to provide a high surface coverage of oligonucleotides essentially attached via a 5′-specific linkage that satisfyingly withstands PCR conditions and leaves the 3′-ends available for DNA polymerase activity. The best results were obtained with 5′-thiol-modified oligonucleotides attached to amino-silanised glass slides using a heterobifunctional cross-linker reagent. It was then demonstrated that the primers bound to the glass surface using the optimal chemistry can be involved in attaching and amplifying DNA molecules present in the reaction mix in the absence of freely-diffusing primers. Two distinct amplification processes called interfacial and surface amplification have been observed and characterised. The newly synthesised DNA can be detected and quantified by radioactive and fluorescent hybridisation assays. These new surface amplification processes are seen as an interesting approach for attachment of DNA molecules by their 5′-end on a solid support and can be used as an alternative route for producing DNA chips for genomic studies.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11024189</NOTES><URL>10.1093/nar/28.20.e87</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/20/e87</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We have characterized the derivatized surfaces for the chemical attachment of oligonucleotides and evaluate the properties relevant for the amplification process: surface density, thermal stability towards thermocycling, functionalization reproducibility and storage stability. The derivatization process, first developed for glass slides, was then adapted to microfabricated glass channels containing integrated fluidic connections. This implementation resulted in an important reduction of reaction times, consumption of reagents and process automation. Innovative analytical methods for the characterization of attached DNA were developed for assessing the surface immobilized DNA content after amplification. The results obtained showed that the BTA chemistry is compatible and suitable for forming highly dense arrays of DNA colonies with optimal surface coverage of about 10 million colonies/cm2 from the amplification of initial single-template DNA molecules immobilized. We also demonstrate that the dsDNA colonies generated can be quantitatively processed in situ by restriction enzymes digestion. DNA colonies generated using the BTA reagent can be used for further sequence analysis in an unprecedented parallel fashion for low-cost genomic studies.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 16473845</NOTES><URL>10.1093/nar/gnj023</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/3/e22</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nbt1486</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nbt/journal/v26/n10/abs/nbt1486.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In such projects, the physical map is assembled by first “fingerprinting” a large number of clones chosen at random from a recombinant library and then inferring overlaps between clones with sufficiently similar fingerprints. Although the basic approach is the same, there are many possible choices for the fingerprint used to characterize the clones and the rules for declaring overlap. In this paper, we derive simple formulas showing how the progress of a physical mapping project is affected by the nature of the fingerprinting scheme.

Waterman (1988, Genomics 2:231–239) have recently provided a mathematical analysis of such physical mapping schemes, useful for planning such a project. Another approach is to assemble the physical map by “anchoring” a large number of random clones—that is, by taking random short regions called anchors and identifying the clones containing each anchor. Here, we provide a mathematical analysis of such a physical mapping scheme.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/0888-7543(91)90004-X</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/088875439190004X</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

These analyses provide a global view of the chromatin architecture of a multicellular animal at extremely high density and resolution. While we observe some degree of reproducible positioning throughout the genome in our mixed stage population of animals, we note that the major chromatin feature in the worm is a diversity of allowed nucleosome positions at the vast majority of individual loci. While absolute positioning of nucleosomes can vary substantially, relative positioning of nucleosomes (in a repeated array structure likely to be maintained at least in part by steric constraints) appears to be a significant property of chromatin structure. The high density of nucleosomal reads enabled a substantial extension of previous analysis describing the usage of individual oligonucleotide sequences along the span of the nucleosome core and linker. We release this data set, via the UCSC Genome Browser, as a resource for the high-resolution analysis of chromatin conformation and DNA accessibility at individual loci within the C. elegans genome.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 18477713</NOTES><URL>10.1101/gr.076463.108</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/7/1051</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Principal Findings We compare here the ability of two leading high-throughput platforms for paired-end deep sequencing, SOLiD (ABI) and Genome Analyzer (Illumina; “Solexa”), to achieve the goal of mutant detection. As a test case we used a mutant C. elegans strain that harbors a mutation in the lsy-12 locus which we compare to the reference wild-type genome sequence. We analyzed the accuracy, sensitivity, and depth-coverage characteristics of the two platforms. Both platforms were able to identify the mutation that causes the phenotype of the mutant C. elegans strain, lsy-12. Based on a 4 MB genomic region in which individual variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, we observe tradeoffs between rates of false positives and false negatives when using both platforms under similar coverage and mapping criteria. Significance In conclusion, whole-genome sequencing conducted by either platform is a viable approach for the identification of single-nucleotide variations in the C. elegans genome.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pone.0004012</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004012</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Conceptually, this sequencing approach is based on eavesdropping on the activity of DNA polymerase carrying out template-directed DNA polymerization. Performed in a highly parallel operational mode, sequential base additions catalyzed by each polymerase are detected with terminal phosphate-linked, fluorescence-labeled nucleotides. This chapter will first outline the principle of this single-molecule, real-time (SMRT™) DNA sequencing method, followed by descriptions of its underlying components and typical sequencing run conditions. Two examples are provided which illustrate that, in addition to the DNA sequence, the dynamics of DNA polymerization from each enzyme molecules is directly accessible: the determination of base-specific kinetic parameters from single-molecule sequencing reads, and the characterization of DNA synthesis rate heterogeneities.</ABSTRACT><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687910720012</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

An implementation of a single-chip 2×2 array fabricated in an unmodified commercial 0.35 μm CMOS process is presented. All signal acquisition is performed in-situ and all readout circuitry is located on-chip. On return from the foundry, the devices are exposed to ultraviolet light to eliminate any difference in threshold voltage. The circuit provides a sufficient linear range that allows the FET devices to operate as pH sensors in the array.

The ISFETs presented include an intermediate gate formed by one or more conducting layers placed between the gate oxide and the sensing layer. The combination of the highly isolating gate oxide of the MOS with a leaky or conducting sensing layer allows the use of low temperature materials that do not damage the CMOS chip.

An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside 5'-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8\%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nnano.2009.12</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nnano/journal/v4/n4/full/nnano.2009.12.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The simplest form of nanopore DNA sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that individual nucleotides of single-stranded DNA passing through a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield the DNA sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore. These findings highlight the importance of MspA in the future of nanopore sequencing.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 20798343</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.1001831107</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16060</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Each biosensor element consists of an individual DNA oligonucleotide covalently attached within the lumen of the -hemolysin (HL) pore to form a "DNA–nanopore". The binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules to the tethered DNA strand causes changes in the ionic current flowing through a nanopore. On the basis of DNA duplex lifetimes, the DNA–nanopores are able to discriminate between individual DNA strands up to 30 nucleotides in length differing by a single base substitution. This was exemplified by the detection of a drug resistance–conferring mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV. In addition, the approach was used to sequence a complete codon in an individual DNA strand tethered to a nanopore.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/90236</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nbt/journal/v19/n7/abs/nbt0701_636.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We find that the holes induce a region of reduced flux density extending toward the nearest sample edge, in addition to the parabolic d lines. The region of reduced flux density is due to compression of current streamlines and is accompanied by a significantly enhanced flux traffic.

Recently, this has inspired the use of protein and solid-state nanopores as single-molecule sensors for the detection and structural analysis of DNA and RNA by voltage-driven translocation. The magnitude of the force involved is of fundamental importance in understanding and exploiting this translocation mechanism, yet so far it has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate the first measurements of the force on a single DNA molecule in a solid-state nanopore by combining optical tweezers with ionic-current detection. The opposing force exerted by the optical tweezers can be used to slow down and even arrest the translocation of the DNA molecules. We obtain a value of 0.240.02 pN mV-1 for the force on a single DNA molecule, independent of salt concentration from 0.02 to 1 M KCl. This force corresponds to an effective charge of 0.500.05 electrons per base pair equivalent to a 75\% reduction of the bare DNA charge.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nphys344</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nphys/journal/v2/n7/abs/nphys344.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To sequence DNA with a nanopore requires that adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G) produce distinct current signals as they traverse the pore. Recently, we demonstrated that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, and thymine immobilized in the nanopore protein α-hemolysin (αHL) produced distinct current blockades dependent on their chemical orientation. To probe the detection limit of αHL, we examined immobilized single strands of T40 DNA (polyT) with single base substitutions of A, C, and G at 12 positions on the strand occupying the stem region of αHL. We find blockade currents sensitive to base identity over most of these positions with the most sensitive region near the pore constriction. Adenine substitutions increase the measured blockade current to values intermediate to the polyT and polyA currents at a number of positions, while C substitutions increase the current to a level intermediate to polyT and polyC values in some positions, but decrease it below polyT in others. These changes in blockade current were also observed for G substitutions. These results indicate that total blockade currents measured in αHL arise from nucleotides at multiple locations and thus are not uniquely attributable to an individual base in a specific position, a finding consistent with a recently published study. The measurements of C and G substitutions also suggest that blockade current may be modulated through interactions between nucleotides and the pore interior at multiple sites in αHL.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1021/nn900441x</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn900441x</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The porin MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis has remarkable stability against environmental stresses and can be rationally modified based on its crystal structure. Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of ≈20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule ≈100 times longer than the first mutant. Our results introduce MspA as a nanopore for nucleic acid analysis and highlight its potential as an engineerable platform for single-molecule detection and characterization applications.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 19098105</NOTES><URL>10.1073/pnas.0807514106</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/105/52/20647</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We discuss extensions of the nanopore microscope concept to alternative probing mechanisms and applications, including the study of molecular structure and sequencing.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nmat965</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nmat/journal/v2/n9/abs/nmat965.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Long DNA molecules with different lengths ranging from 6500 to 97000 base pairs have been electrophoretically driven through a 10 nm pore. We observe a power-law scaling of the translocation time with the length, with an exponent of 1.27. This nonlinear scaling is strikingly different from the well-studied linear behavior observed in similar experiments performed on protein pores. We present a theoretical model where hydrodynamic drag on the section of the polymer outside the pore is the dominant force counteracting the electrical driving force. We show that this applies to our experiments, and we derive a power-law scaling with an exponent of 1.22, in good agreement with the data.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1021/nl048030d</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl048030d</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

HIV, however, encodes a protein (virion infectivity factor, Vif [6, 7]), which overcomes APOBEC3G-mediated restriction but by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Vif triggers APOBEC3G degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway and that an 80 amino acid region of APOBEC3G surrounding its first zinc coordination motif is sufficient to confer the ability to partake in an interaction involving Vif. Inhibitors of this interaction might therefore prove therapeutically useful in blocking Vif-mediated APOBEC3G destruction.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.cub.2003.10.034</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982203007899</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Azidothymidine was studied as an antineoplastic in the 1990s, but despite promising in vitro data, clinical trials showed little antitumour activity. HIV protease inhibitors were developed in the early 1990s, and their subsequent incorporation into highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has profoundly changed the natural history of HIV infection. The potential antitumour properties of these drugs have been investigated because of their success in treating HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma. HAART's effects on Kaposi's sarcoma did not always correlate with immune reconstitution, and activity against other solid and haematological malignancies has been established. Inhibition of tumour-cell invasion and angiogenesis were properties first ascribed to inhibition of HIV protease; however, they have pleiotropic antitumour effects, including inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production, proteasome activity, cell proliferation and survival, and induction of apoptosis. HIV protease inhibitors are thus a new class of anticancer drugs with multiple effects, and other anti-HIV drugs might hold similar promise.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70334-6</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204508703346</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

IN mediates two critical reactions during viral replication; firstly 3′-end processing (3′EP) of the double-stranded viral DNA ends and then strand transfer (STF) which joins the viral DNA to the host chromosomal DNA forming a functional integrated proviral DNA. IN is a 288 amino acid protein containing three functional domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), catalytic core domain (CCD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The CCD contains three conserved catalytic residues, Asp64, Asp116 and Glu152, which coordinate divalent metal ions essential for the STF reaction. Intensive research over the last two decades has led to the discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors of the IN STF reaction (INSTIs). INSTIs are catalytic inhibitors of IN, and act to chelate the divalent metal ions in the CCD. One INSTI, raltegravir (RAL, Merck Inc.) was approved in late 2007 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients with prior antiretroviral (ARV) treatment experience and was recently approved also for first line therapy. A second INSTI, elvitegravir (EVG, Gilead Sciences, Inc.) is currently undergoing phase 3 studies in ARV treatment-experienced patients and phase 2 studies in ARV naïve patients as part of a novel fixed dose combination. Several additional INSTIs are in early stage clinical development. This review will discuss the discovery and development of this novel class of antiretrovirals. This article forms part of a special issue of Antiviral Research marking the 25th anniversary of antiretroviral drug discovery and development, Vol 85, issue 1, 2010.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.11.004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209005336</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We compare sequencing platforms from Roche/454(GS FLX), Illumina/HiSeq (HiSeq 2000), and Life Technologies/SOLiD (SOLiD 3 ECC) for their ability to identify single nucleotide substitutions in whole genome sequences from the same human sample. We report on significant GC-related bias observed in the data sequenced on Illumina and SOLiD platforms. The differences in the variant calls were investigated with regards to coverage, and sequencing error. Some of the variants called by only one or two of the platforms were experimentally tested using mass spectrometry; a method that is independent of DNA sequencing. We establish several causes why variants remained unreported, specific to each platform. We report the indel called using the three sequencing technologies and from the obtained results we conclude that sequencing human genomes with more than a single platform and multiple libraries is beneficial when high level of accuracy is required.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pone.0055089</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055089</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

To evaluate the performance of these sequencing technologies, investigation of the quality of sequence reads obtained from these methods is important. In this study, we analyzed the quality of sequence reads and SNP detection performance using three commercially available next-generation sequencers, i.e., Roche Genome Sequencer FLX System (FLX), Illumina Genome Analyzer (GA), and Applied Biosystems SOLiD system (SOLiD). A common genomic DNA sample obtained from Escherichia coli strain DH1 was applied to these sequencers. The obtained sequence reads were aligned to the complete genome sequence of E. coli DH1, to evaluate the accuracy and sequence bias of these sequence methods. We found that the fraction of “junk” data, which could not be aligned to the reference genome, was largest in the data set of SOLiD, in which about half of reads could not be aligned. Among data sets after alignment to the reference, sequence accuracy was poorest in GA data sets, suggesting relatively low fidelity of the elongation reaction in the GA method. Furthermore, by aligning the sequence reads to the E. coli strain W3110, we screened sequence differences between two E. coli strains using data sets of three different next-generation platforms. The results revealed that the detected sequence differences were similar among these three methods, while the sequence coverage required for the detection was significantly small in the FLX data set. These results provided valuable information on the quality of short sequence reads and the performance of SNP detection in three next-generation sequencing platforms.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pone.0019534</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019534</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Disease studies that involve sequencing hundreds of patient genomes are underway. The all-inclusive sequencing price per genome is expected to reach \$1000 over the next few years and will likely decline further in the following years. This dramatic price decline will herald widespread personal genome sequencing and lead to significant improvements in human health and reduced health care costs. Key to realizing these benefits will be medical genomics' and systems biology's success in providing increasing contextual interpretation of biological and medical effects of the detected sequence variants in a genome. Given the substantial potential benefits and the manageability of the health and discrimination risks involved with the possible misuse of this information, we propose that governments and insurance companies support or even require personal genome sequencing. Critical to the widespread acceptance of personal genome sequencing, however, will be the need to educate physicians and the public about the realistic benefits and risks of such an analysis to prevent overinterpretation and misuse of this valuable information.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1097/GIM.0b013e31820f16e6</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/gim/journal/v13/n3/abs/gim9201135a.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The T-cell tropism of HTLV and its prevalence in the Caribbean basin prompted a search for it in patients with the epidemic T-cell immune deficiency disorder known as AIDS. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from one patient in the United States and two in France were cultured with T-cell growth factor (TCGF) an shown to express HTLV antigens. Virus from the U.S. patient was isolated and characterized and shown to be related to HTLV subgroup I. The virus was also transmitted into normal human T cells from umbilical cord blood of a newborn. Whether or not HTLV-I or other retroviruses of this family with T-cell tropism cause AIDS, it is possible that patients from whom the virus can be isolated can also transmit it to others. If the target cell of AIDS is the mature T cell as suspected, the methods used in these studies may prove useful for the long-term growth of these cells and for the identification of antigens specific for the etiological agent of AIDS.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 6601823</NOTES></RECORD>

The failure of HIV-2 and especially HIV-1 group O to spread following the initial zoonotic jumps is not well understood. This study was designed to examine the relative replicative capacities between these human lentiviruses. A pairwise competition experiment was performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells with eight HIV-2 isolates, 6 group O viruses, and 15 group M viruses of subtype A (2 viruses), B (5 viruses), C (4 viruses), D (2 viruses) and CRF01\_AE (2 viruses). HIV-1 group M isolates of any subtype were typically 100-fold-more fit than group O or HIV-2 strains when competed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from various humans. This order in replicative fitness was also observed when virus pairs were added to human dendritic cells and then cocultured with primary, quiescent T cells, which is the model for HIV-1 transmission. These results suggest that reduced replicative and transmission fitness may be contributing to the low prevalence and limited geographical spread of HIV-2 and group O HIV-1 in the human population.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15994792</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.79.14.8979-8990.2005</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/79/14/8979</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The absence of vpu resulted in an accumulation of cell-associated viral proteins and impaired the release of progeny virions. Both electron microscopic and biochemical analyses indicated that a large proportion of the mutant particles was attached to the surface of infected cells. Significant variation in the size and shape of these progeny virions was observed. In addition, intracytoplasmic particles, some of which formed aberrant budding structures, were visualized in T cells infected with the vpu mutant. Indirect immunofluorescence analyses of cultures inoculated with wild-type virus with use of a vpu-specific antiserum demonstrated that vpu is mainly localized to a perinuclear region in the cytoplasm of virus-producing cells.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2404139</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/64/2/621</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Here, we infer the population genetics and epidemic history of HIV-1 group O from viral gene sequence data and evaluate the effect of variable evolutionary rates and recombination on our estimates. First, model selection tools were used to specify suitable evolutionary and coalescent models for HIV group O. Second, divergence times and population genetic parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, under both strict and relaxed molecular clock methods. Our results date the origin of the group O radiation to around 1920 (1890–1940), a time frame similar to that estimated for HIV-1 group M. However, group O infections, which remain almost wholly restricted to Cameroon, show a slower rate of exponential growth during the twentieth century, explaining their lower current prevalence. To explore the effect of recombination, the Bayesian framework is extended to incorporate multiple unlinked loci. Although recombination can bias estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor, this effect does not appear to be important for HIV-1 group O. In addition, we show that evolutionary rate estimates for different HIV genes accurately reflect differential selective constraints along the HIV genome.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15280223</NOTES><URL>10.1534/genetics.104.026666</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.genetics.org/content/167/3/1059</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Several studies have suggested that the membrane-binding signal is contained within the amino-terminal matrix sequence; however, the precise location has never been determined for the Gag protein of any retrovirus. In this report, we show that the first 31 residues of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag protein can function independently as a membrane-targeting domain when fused to heterologous proteins. A bipartite membrane-targeting motif was identified, consisting of the myristylated N-terminal 14 amino acids and a highly basic region that binds acidic phospholipids. Replacement of the N-terminal membrane-targeting domain of pp60v-src with that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag elicits efficient membrane binding and a transforming phenotype. Removal of myristate or the basic region results in decreased membrane binding of Gag-Src chimeras in vitro and impaired virion formation by Pr55gag in vivo. We propose that the N-terminal Gag sequence functions as a targeting signal to direct interaction with acidic phospholipids on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8139035</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/68/4/2556</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Since the Gag polyprotein mediates virion assembly and budding, studies on the localization of Gag within the cell should provide insight into the mechanism of particle assembly. Here, we utilize biochemical fractionation techniques as well as high-resolution confocal imaging of live cells to demonstrate that Gag is localized at the plasma membrane in a striking punctate pattern. Mutation of the N-terminal myristoylation site results in the formation of large cytosolic complexes, whereas mutation of the N-terminal basic residue cluster in the matrix domain redirects the Gag protein to a region partially overlapping the Golgi apparatus.

However, the mechanism by which HIV-1 assembly is targeted specifically to the plasma membrane versus intracellular membranes is largely unknown. Previously, we observed that mutations between residues 84 and 88 of the matrix (MA) domain of HIV-1 Gag cause a retargeting of virus particle formation to an intracellular site. In this study, we demonstrate that the mutant virus assembly occurs in the Golgi or in post-Golgi vesicles. These particles undergo core condensation in a protease-dependent manner, indicating that virus maturation can occur not only on the plasma membrane but also in the Golgi or post-Golgi vesicles. The intracellular assembly of mutant particles is dependent on Gag myristylation but is not influenced by p6Gag or envelope glycoprotein expression. Previous characterization of viral revertants suggested a functional relationship between the highly basic domain of MA (amino acids 17 to 31) and residues 84 to 88. We now demonstrate that mutations in the highly basic domain also retarget virus particle formation to the Golgi or post-Golgi vesicles. Although the basic domain has been implicated in Gag membrane binding, no correlation was observed between the impact of mutations on membrane binding and Gag targeting, indicating that these two functions of MA are genetically separable. Plasma membrane targeting of Gag proteins with mutations in either the basic domain or between residues 84 and 88 was rescued by coexpression with wild-type Gag; however, the two groups of MA mutants could not rescue each other. We propose that the highly basic domain of MA contains a major determinant of HIV-1 Gag plasma membrane targeting and that mutations between residues 84 and 88 disrupt plasma membrane targeting through an effect on the basic domain.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 10684302</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.74.6.2855-2866.2000</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/74/6/2855</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The molecular mechanism by which Gag is targeted to the appropriate subcellular location remains poorly understood. Based on the analysis of mutant Gag proteins, we and others have previously demonstrated that a highly basic patch in the matrix (MA) domain of Gag is a major determinant of Gag transport to the plasma membrane. In this study, we determined that in HeLa and T cells, the MA mutant Gag proteins that are defective in plasma membrane targeting form virus particles in a CD63-positive compartment, defined as the late endosome or multivesicular body (MVB). Interestingly, we find that in primary human macrophages, both wild-type (WT) and MA mutant Gag proteins are targeted specifically to the MVB. Despite the fact that particle assembly in macrophages occurs at an intracellular site rather than at the plasma membrane, we observe that WT Gag expressed in this cell type is released as extracellular virions with high efficiency. These results demonstrate that Gag targeting to and assembly in the MVB are physiologically important steps in HIV-1 virus particle production in macrophages and that particle release in this cell type may follow an exosomal pathway. To determine whether Gag targeting to the MVB is the result of an interaction between the late domain in p6Gag and the MVB sorting machinery (e.g., TSG101), we examined the targeting and assembly of Gag mutants lacking p6. Significantly, the MVB localization of Gag was still observed in the absence of p6, suggesting that an interaction between Gag and TSG101 is not required for Gag targeting to the MVB. These data are consistent with a model for Gag targeting that postulates two different cellular binding partners for Gag, one on the plasma membrane and the other in the MVB.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 14722309</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.78.3.1552-1563.2004</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/78/3/1552</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

However, the mechanism by which NC facilitates the assembly process is not clearly established. Formally, NC could act by constraining the Pr55gag polyprotein into an assembly-competent conformation or by masking residues which block the assembly process. Alternatively, the capacity of NC to bind RNA or make interprotein contacts might affect particle assembly. To examine its role in the assembly process, we replaced the NC domain in Pr55gag with polypeptide domains of known function, and the chimeric proteins were analyzed for their abilities to direct the release of virus-like particles. Our results indicate that NC does not mask inhibitory domains and does not act passively, by simply providing a stable folded monomeric structure. However, replacement of NC by polypeptides which form interprotein contacts permitted efficient virus particle assembly and release, even when RNA was not detected in the particles. These results suggest that formation of interprotein contacts by NC is essential to the normal HIV-1 assembly process.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9499028</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/72/3/1782</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Consistent with previous investigations, a truncation containing only the matrix and capsid regions of Gag was unable to assemble efficiently into particles; also, the pelletable material released was lighter than the density of wild-type HIV-1. A deletion mutant lacking p7 nucleocapsid but containing the C-terminal p6 protein was also inefficient in particle release and released lighter particles, while a truncation containing only the first zinc finger of p7 could assemble more efficiently into virions. These results clearly show that p7 is indispensable for virus assembly and release. Some point mutations in the N-terminal basic domain and in the basic linker region between the two zinc fingers, which had been previously shown to have reduced RNA bindingin vitro[Schmalzbauer, E., Strack, B., Dannull, J., Guehmann, S., and Moelling, K. (1996).J. Virol.70: 771–777], were shown to reduce virus assembly dramatically when expressed in full-length viral clones. A fusion protein consisting of matrix and capsid fused to a heterologous viral protein known to have nonspecific RNA binding activity [Ribas, J. C., Fujimura, T., and Wickner, R. B. (1994)J. Biol. Chem.269: 28420–28428] released pelletable material slightly more efficiently than matrix and capsid alone, and these particles had density higher than matrix and capsid alone. These results demonstrate the essential role of HIV-1 nucleocapsid in the virus assembly process and show that the positively charged N terminus of p7 is critical for this role.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/viro.1998.9374</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298993746</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The HIV capsid is a fullerene cone: a variably curved, closed shell composed of approximately 250 hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers of the viral CA protein. We devised methods for isolating soluble, assembly-competent CA hexamers and derived four crystallographically independent models that define the structure of this capsid assembly unit at atomic resolution. A ring of six CA N-terminal domains form an apparently rigid core, surrounded by an outer ring of C-terminal domains. Mobility of the outer ring appears to be an underlying mechanism for generating the variably curved lattice in authentic capsids. Hexamer-stabilizing interfaces are highly hydrated, and this property may be key to the formation of quasi-equivalent interactions within hexamers and pentamers. The structures also clarify the molecular basis for capsid assembly inhibition and should facilitate structure-based drug design strategies.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.063</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867409005807</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The protein folds into a five-stranded mixed beta sheet flanked by an asymmetric distribution of four alpha helices. Two divalent metal cations bind in the active site surrounded by a cluster of four conserved acidic amino acid residues. The overall structure is similar in most respects to the RNase H from Escherichia coli. Structural features characteristic of the retroviral protein suggest how it may interface with the DNA polymerase domain of p66 in the mature RT heterodimer. These features also offer insights into why the isolated RNase H domain is catalytically inactive but when combined in vitro with the isolated p51 domain of RT RNase H activity can be reconstituted. Surprisingly, the peptide bond cleaved by HIV-1 protease near the polymerase-RNase H junction of p66 is completely inaccessible to solvent in the structure reported here. This suggests that the homodimeric p66-p66 precursor of mature RT is asymmetric with one of the two RNase H domains at least partially unfolded.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1707186</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.1707186</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/252/5002/88</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

In this report, we investigate the molecular basis of this selectivity using the virus-encoded HIV integrase to direct integration of a synthetic HIV long terminal repeat substrate into either DNA molecules of known structure or previously defined nucleosomal complexes. We find that the structure of the target greatly influences the site of integration, and, moreover, DNA curvature, flexibility, and rigidity in solution all influence the frequency of integration. Importantly, for DNA with all of these properties, the distortion of the double helix directed by association with the histone proteins promotes the integration reaction and alters the distribution of sites that are selected for integration. We suggest that both intrinsic DNA structure and the folding of DNA into chromosomal structures will exert a major influence on target site selection for integration of the viral genome.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7929189</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jbc.org/content/269/40/25031</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Using cryo-electron tomography combined with three-dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three-dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV-1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV-1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4-bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes.

The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, are assembled into a trimeric complex that mediates virus entry into target cells. HIV-1 entry depends on the sequential interaction of the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein with the receptors on the cell, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 glycoprotein, which can be shed from the envelope complex, elicits both virus-neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies during natural infection. Antibodies that lack neutralizing activity are often directed against the gp120 regions that are occluded on the assembled trimer and which are exposed only upon shedding,. Neutralizing antibodies, by contrast, must access the functional envelope glycoprotein complex and typically recognize conserved or variable epitopes near the receptor-binding regions. Here we describe the spatial organization of conserved neutralization epitopes on gp120, using epitope maps in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of a ternary complex that includes a gp120 core, CD4 and a neutralizing antibody. A large fraction of the predicted accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer is composed of variable, heavily glycosylated core and loop structures that surround the receptor-binding regions.

Three-dimensional averaging showed that the surface glycoprotein (gp120) 'head' of each subunit of the trimeric SIV spike contains a primary mass, with two secondary lobes. The transmembrane glycoprotein 'stalk' of each trimer is composed of three independent legs that project obliquely from the trimer head, tripod-like. Reconciling available atomic structures with the three-dimensional whole spike density map yields insights into the orientation of Env spike structural elements and possible structural bases of their functions.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1038/nature04817</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/nature/journal/v441/n7095/full/nature04817.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein that mediates fusion consists of the surface subunit gp120 and the transmembrane subunit gp41. gp120 directs virion attachment to the cell–surface receptors, and gp41 then promotes viral–cell membrane fusion. A soluble, α-helical, trimeric complex within gp41 composed of N-terminal and C-terminal extraviral segments has been proposed to represent the core of the fusion-active conformation of the HIV-1 envelope. A thermostable subdomain denoted N34(L6)C28 can be formed by the N-34 and C-28 peptides connected by a flexible linker in place of the disulfide-bonded loop region. Three-dimensional structure of N34(L6)C28 reveals that three molecules fold into a six-stranded helical bundle. Three N-terminal helices within the bundle form a central, parallel, trimeric coiled coil, whereas three C-terminal helices pack in the reverse direction into three hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the N-terminal trimer. This thermostable subdomain displays the salient features of the core structure of the isolated gp41 subunit and thus provides a possible target for therapeutics designed selectively to block HIV-1 entry.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9356444</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.pnas.org/content/94/23/12303</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Both Env subunits undergo conformational changes triggered by the gp120-mediated interactions with cellular receptors. Notably, gp41 refolds into a core six-helical bundle structure which is central to the fusion process. Here we report the structural basis for the folding of the linker regions connecting to the membrane anchors of gp41, namely to the transmembrane region (MPER) and to the fusion peptide (FPPR). Our structural analysis shows helical assemblies of FPPR and MPER which increase the melting temperature of gp41 and position the fusion peptide towards the outside of the six-helix bundle structure at this stage of gp41 refolding. It suggests that part of MPER must be inserted into the viral membrane, which would induce membrane curvature as postulated to be required for the fusion reaction. Thus our findings shed new light on the refolding of gp41, which contributes energy to the fusion reaction and reveals for the first time the structural principles of MPER membrane interaction within trimeric gp41. We propose that the structure presents a late fusion intermediate state that provides a new framework for fusion inhibitor development and MPER immunogen design.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.ppat.1000880</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000880</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Its mechanism of action has not yet been defined. We applied Pepscan strategy to determine the relationship between functional domains and mechanisms of action of five 36-mer overlapping peptides with a shift of five amino acids (aa): CHR-1 (aa 623–658), C36 (aa 628–663), CHR-3 (aa 633–668), T20 (aa 638–673), and CHR-5 (aa 643–678). C36 is a peptide with addition of two aa to the N terminus of C34. Peptides CHR-1 and C36 contain N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR)- and pocket-binding domains. They inhibited HIV-1 fusion by interacting with gp41 NHR, forming stable six-helix bundles and blocking gp41 core formation. Peptide T20 containing partial NHR- and lipid-binding domains, but lacking pocket-binding domain, blocked viral fusion by binding its N- and C-terminal sequences with gp41 NHR and cell membrane, respectively. Peptide CHR-3, which is located in the middle between C36 and T20, overlaps \textgreater86\% of the sequences of these two peptides, and lacks pocket- and lipid-binding domains, exhibited marginal anti-HIV-1 activity. These results suggest that T20 and C36 contain different functional domains, through which they inhibit HIV-1 entry with distinct mechanisms of action. The multiple functional domains in gp41 CHR and their binding partners may serve as targets for rational design of new anti-HIV-1 drugs and vaccines.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 17276993</NOTES><URL>10.1074/jbc.M609148200</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.jbc.org/content/282/13/9612</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We designed a peptide, IQN17, which properly presents this pocket. Utilizing IQN17 and mirror-image phage display, we identified cyclic, D-peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 infection that share a sequence motif. A 1.5 Å cocrystal structure of IQN17 in complex with a D-peptide, and NMR studies, show that conserved residues of these inhibitors make intimate contact with the gp41 pocket.

HIV Env–induced fusion was studied to resolve whether membrane merger was due to the transition into the bundle configuration or occurred after bundle formation. Suboptimal temperature was used to arrest fusion at an intermediate stage. When bundle formation was prevented by adding inhibitory peptides at this stage, membranes did not merge upon raising temperature. Inversely, when membrane merger was prevented by incorporating lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into cell membranes at the intermediate, the bundle did not form upon optimizing temperature. In the absence of LPC, the six-helix bundle did not form when the temperature of the intermediate was raised for times too short to promote fusion. Kinetic measures showed that after the temperature pulse, cells had not advanced further toward fusion. The latter results indicate that bundle formation is the rate-limiting step between the arrested intermediate and fusion. Electrical measures showed that the HIV Env–induced pore is initially large and grows rapidly. It is proposed that bundle formation and fusion are each contingent on the other and that movement of Env during its transition into the six-helix bundle directly induces the lipid rearrangements of membrane fusion. Because peptide inhibition showed that, at the intermediate stage, the heptad repeats of gp41 have become stably exposed, creation of the intermediate could be of importance in drug and/or vaccine development.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 11038187</NOTES><URL>10.1083/jcb.151.2.413</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jcb.rupress.org/content/151/2/413</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Notably, the negatively charged residue Asp632 located at the pocket-binding motif in the C-terminal heptad repeat interacts with the positively charged residue Lys574 in the pocket formation region of the N-terminal heptad repeat to form a salt bridge. We previously demonstrated that the residue Lys574 plays an essential role in six-helix bundle formation and virus infectivity and is a key determinant of the target for anti-HIV fusion inhibitors. In this study, the functionality of residue Asp632 has been specifically characterized by mutational analysis and biophysical approaches. We show that Asp632 substitutions with positively charged residues (D632K and D632R) or a hydrophobic residue (D632V) could completely abolish Env-mediated viral entry, while a protein with a conserved substitution (D632E) retained its activity. Similar to the Lys574 mutations, nonconserved substitutions of Asp632 also severely impaired the α-helicity, stability, and conformation of six-helix bundles as shown by N36 and C34 peptides as a model system. Furthermore, nonconserved substitutions of Asp632 significantly reduced the potency of C34 to sequestrate six-helix bundle formation and to inhibit HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection, suggesting its importance for designing antiviral fusion inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that the salt bridge between the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions of the fusion-active HIV-1 gp41 core structure is critical for viral entry and inhibition.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 18768964</NOTES><URL>10.1128/JVI.01060-08</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/82/22/11129</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

PICs can be isolated from HIV-1-infected cells, and such particles are capable of carrying out integration reactions in vitro. We find that although the PICs are large, the cDNA must be condensed to fit into the measured volume. The ends of the cDNA are probably linked by a protein bridge, since coordinated joining of the two ends is not disrupted by cleaving the cDNA internally with a restriction enzyme. cDNA ends in PICs were protected from digestion by added exonucleases, probably due to binding of proteins. The intervening cDNA, in contrast, was susceptible to attack by endonucleases. Previous work has established that the virus-encoded integrase protein is present in PICs, and we have reported recently that the host protein HMG I(Y) is also present. Here we report that the viral matrix and reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins also cofractionated with PICs through several steps whereas capsid and nucleocapsid proteins dissociated. These data support a model of PIC organization in which the cDNA is condensed in a partially disassembled remnant of the viral core, with proteins tightly associated at the apposed cDNA ends but loosely associated with the intervening cDNA. In characterizing the structure of the cDNA ends, we found that the U5 DNA ends created by RT were ragged, probably due to the terminal transferase activity of RT. Only molecules correctly cleaved by integrase protein at the 3' ends were competent to integrate, suggesting that one role for terminal cleavage by integrase may be to create a defined end at otherwise heterogeneous cDNA termini.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 9188609</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/71/7/5382</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Genetic evidence suggests that viral protein R (Vpr) and matrix antigen (MA) are directly involved in the import process. An in vitro assay that reconstitutes nuclear import of HIV-1 pre-integration complexes in digitonin-permeabilized cells was used to demonstrate that Vpr is the key regulator of the viral nuclear import process. Mutant HIV-1 pre-integration complexes that lack Vpr failed to be imported in vitro, whereas mutants that lack a functional MA nuclear localization sequence (NLS) were only partially defective. Strikingly, the import defect of the Vpr- mutant was rescued when recombinant Vpr was re-added. In addition, import of Vpr- virus was rescued by adding the cytosol of HeLa cells, where HIV-1 replication had been shown to be Vpr-independent. In a solution binding assay, Vpr associated with karyopherin , a cellular receptor for NLSs. This association increased the affinity of karyopherin for basic-type NLSs, including that of MA, thus explaining the positive effect of Vpr on nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex and BSA–NLS conjugates. These results identify the biochemical mechanism of Vpr function in transport of the viral pre-integration complex to, and across, the nuclear membrane.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1093/emboj/17.4.909</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.nature.com.libgate.library.nuigalway.ie/emboj/journal/v17/n4/abs/7590823a.html</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The mechanism used by retroviruses for nuclear targeting of preintegration complexes and dependence on cell division has not been established. Our studies show that, after infection, the preintegration complex of HIV-1 was rapidly transported to the nucleus of the host cell by a process that required ATP but was independent of cell division. Functional HIV-1 integrase, an essential component of the preintegration complex, was not required for nuclear import of these complexes. The ability of HIV-1 to use host cell active transport processes for nuclear import of the viral preintegration complex obviates the requirement for host cell division in establishment of the integrated provirus.

This property relies on the use of a nuclear import pathway enabling the viral DNA to cross the nuclear membrane of the host cell. In HIV-1 reverse transcription, a central strand displacement event consecutive to central initiation and termination of plus strand synthesis creates a plus strand overlap: the central DNA flap. We show here that the central DNA flap acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA nuclear import. Wild-type viral linear DNA is almost entirely imported into the nucleus where it integrates or circularizes. In contrast, mutant viral DNA, which lacks the DNA flap, accumulates in infected cells as unintegrated linear DNA, at the vicinity of the nuclear membrane. Consistently, HIV-1 vectors devoid of DNA flap exhibit a strong defect of nuclear import, which can be corrected to wild-type levels by reinsertion of the DNA flap sequence.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80828-4</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400808284</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We introduced specific amino acid substitutions at a number of the conserved residue positions of recombinant HIV-1 integrase. Some of these substitutions resulted in proteins which were not able to be purified in the same manner as the wild-type enzyme, and these were not studied further. The remaining mutant enzymes were assessed for their abilities to perform functions characteristic of the integrase protein. These included specific removal of the terminal dinucleotides from oligonucleotide substrates representative of the viral U5-long terminal repeat, nonspecific cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates, and mediation of the strand transfer (integration) reaction. Substitution at position 43, within the protein's zinc finger motif region, resulted in an enzyme with reduced specificity for cleavage of the terminal dinucleotide. In addition, a double substitution of aspartic acid and glutamine for valine and glutamic acid, respectively, at positions 151 and 152 within the D,D(35)E motif region rendered the integrase protein inactive for all of its functions. The introduction of this double substitution into an infectious HIV-1 provirus yielded a mutant virus that was incapable of productively infecting human T-lymphoid cells in culture.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 1433523</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/66/12/7414</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Using an integrase assay with a chemiluminescent readout adapted to a 96-well plate format, the effect of LEDGF/p75 on both the 3?-processing and strand transfer steps was analyzed. Integrase inhibitors of the strand transfer reaction remained active in the presence of LEDGF/p75, but displayed 3- to 7-fold higher IC50 values. Our analyses indicate that, in the presence of 150 nM LEDGF/p75, active integrase/donor DNA complexes were increased by 5.3-fold during the 3?-processing step. In addition, these integrase/donor DNA complexes showed a 4.5-fold greater affinity for the target DNA during the subsequent strand transfer step. We also observed a 3.7-fold increase in the rate constant of catalysis of the strand transfer step when 150 nM LEDGF/p75 was present during the 3?-processing step. In contrast, when LEDGF/p75 was added at the beginning of the strand transfer step, no increase in either the concentration of active integrase/donor DNA complex or its rate constant of strand transfer catalysis was observed. This observation suggested that the integrase/donor DNA formed in the absence of LEDGF/p75 became refractory to the stimulatory effect of LEDGF/p75. Instead, this LEDGF/p75 added at the start of the strand transfer step was able to promote the formation of a new cohort of active integrase/donor DNA complexes which became functional with a delay of 45 min after LEDGF/p75 addition. We propose a model whereby LEDGF/p75 can only bind integrase before the latter binds donor DNA whereas donor DNA can engage either free or LEDGF/p75-bound integrase.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1021/bi602387u</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi602387u</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Fluorescence is partially quenched within an oligonucleotide and the degree of quench is a function of the fluorophore's proximity to purines and Its position In the oligonucleotide. As an example of the potential utility of this class of fluorophores, we developed a continuous assay for HIV-1 integrase 3-processlng reaction by incorporating 3-MI at the cleavage site In a double-stranded oligonucleotide identical to the U5 terminal sequence of the HIV genome. Integrase cleaves the 3-terminal dlnucleotide containing the fluorophore, resulting in an increase in fluorescence which can be monitored on a spectrofluorometer. Substitution of the fluorophore for guanosine at the cleavage site does not Inhibit integrase activity. This assay is specific for the 3′-processing reaction.

Every step of the viral life cycle, from entry to budding, is orchestrated through interactions with cellular proteins. Accordingly, viruses will hijack and manipulate these proteins utilising any achievable mechanism. Yet, the extensive interactions of viral proteomes has yielded a conundrum: how do viruses commandeer so many diverse pathways and processes, given the obvious spatial constraints imposed by their compact genomes?

The roles played by HIV-1 Gag proteins during the life cycle are numerous and complex, involving not only assembly but also virion maturation after particle release and early postentry steps in virus replication. As the individual Gag domains carry out their diverse functions, they must engage in interactions with themselves, other Gag proteins, other viral proteins, lipid, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), and host cell proteins. This review briefly summarizes our current understanding of how HIV-1 Gag proteins function in the virus life cycle.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/viro.1998.9398</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298993989</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Eleven individuals remained asymptomatic; nine progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) at the time point at which the last HIV isolate was obtained. In 16 individuals, only non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) isolates, with a host range restricted to mononuclear cells, were observed. From four individuals, high-replicating, syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates that could be transmitted to the H9, RC2A, and U937 cell lines were recovered. From two of these four individuals, SI isolates were obtained throughout the observation period. In the two others, a transition from NSI to SI HIV isolates was observed during the period of study. Three of these four individuals developed ARC or AIDS 9 to 15 months after the first isolation of an SI isolate. With the exception of the two individuals in whom a transition from NSI to SI isolates was observed, within a given individual the replication rate of sequential HIV isolates was constant. A significant correlation was found between the mean replication rate of isolates obtained from an individual and the rate of CD4+ cell decrease observed in this individual. In individuals with low-replicating HIV isolates, no significant CD4+ cell loss was observed. In contrast, recovery of high-replicating isolates, in particular when these were SI isolates, was associated with rapid decline of CD4+ cell numbers and development of ARC or AIDS. These findings indicate that variability in the biological properties of HIV isolates is one of the factors influencing the course of HIV infection.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 2564898</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/63/5/2118</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 7541846</NOTES><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jvi.asm.org/content/69/8/5087</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Strains were sequenced in four genomic regions: gag (p24) and three env regions (C2-V3, gp41, and for 22 C2-gp41). In each of the genomic regions analyzed, the genetic diversity among the group O strains was higher than that exhibited by group M. We characterize three major group O phylogenetic clusters (O:A, O:B, and O:C) that comprised the same virus strains in each of the genomic regions analyzed. The majority of strains cluster in O:A, a cluster previously identified by analysis of pol and env sequences. Group O recombinants were also identified. Importantly, the distinction between these three major group O clades was weak compared to the strong clustering apparent in the global group M phylogenetic tree that led to the identification of subtypes. Thus, these clusters of group O viruses should not be considered as equivalent to the group M subtypes. This difference between the pattern of group O and the global group M diversity, both taking into account the pandemic status of the group M subtypes and the comparatively small number of group O-infected individuals (the majority being from Cameroon), indicates that the group O phylogeny primarily represents viral divergence in the Cameroon region, analogous to group M viral diversity present in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1006/viro.2002.1430</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202914303</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of HIV infection. Here we describe examples of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple HIV strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1007/BF00163230</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00163230</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 × 109 virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time—defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles—is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 8599114</NOTES><URL>10.1126/science.271.5255.1582</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/271/5255/1582</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

The distribution of subtypes is often unique to a given geographic region of the world and constitutes a useful epidemiological and surveillance resource. The effects of viral subtype on disease progression, treatment outcome and vaccine design are being actively researched, and the importance of accurate subtyping procedures is clear. In HIV-1, subtype assignment is complicated by frequent recombination among co-circulating strains, creating new genetic mosaics or recombinant forms: 43 have been characterized to date, and many more likely exist. We present an automated phylogenetic method (SCUEAL) to accurately characterize both simple and complex HIV-1 mosaics. Using computer simulations and biological data we demonstrate that SCUEAL performs very well under various conditions, especially when some of the existing classification procedures fail. Furthermore, we show that a small, but noticeable proportion of subtype characterization stored in public databases may be incomplete or incorrect. The computational technique introduced here should provide a much more accurate characterization of HIV-1 strains, especially novel recombinants, and lead to new insights into molecular history, epidemiology and geographical distribution of the virus.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000581</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000581</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

NRTIs are deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, but lack a free 3′-hydroxyl group. Once NRTIs are incorporated into the nascent viral DNA, in reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), further viral DNA synthesis is effectively terminated. NRTIs should therefore represent the ideal antiviral agent. Unfortunately, HIV-1 inevitably develops resistance to these inhibitors, and this resistance correlates with mutations in RT. To date, three phenotypic mechanisms have been identified or proposed to account for HIV-1 RT resistance to NRTIs. These mechanisms include alterations of RT discrimination between NRTIs and the analogous dNTP (direct effects on NRTI binding and/or incorporation), alterations in RT-template/primer interactions, which may influence subsequent NRTI incorporation, and enhanced removal of the chain-terminating residue from the 3′ end of the primer. These different resistance phenotypes seem to correlate with different sets of mutations in RT. This review discusses the relationship between HIV-1 drug resistance genotype and phenotype, in relation to our current knowledge of HIV-1 RT structure.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1007/PL00000626</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00000626</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

We assessed the transmission of drug-resistant variants among individuals with primary HIV-1 infection. Methods Population-based sequencing of the viral reverse-transcriptase and protease genes derived from plasma viral RNA was done in 82 consecutive individuals with documented primary HIV-1 infection from January, 1996, to July, 1998. Phenotypic resistance to protease inhibitors was assessed by recombinant virus assay in individuals with two or more mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors. Findings Zidovudine-resistance mutations were detected in seven (9\%) of 82 individuals. Mutations associated with resistance to other reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTls) were detected in two individuals. Primary-resistance mutations associated with protease inhibitors (V82A, L90M) were detected in three (4\%) of 70 individuals; two of these had also RTl-resistance mutations. Decreased sensitivity to three or four protease inhibitors was seen in three individuals, one of whom was infected with HIV-1 variants that harboured 12 mutations associated with resistance to multiple RTl and protease inhibitors. Interpretation To introduce the best antiretroviral treatment, resistance testing should be done in recently HIV-1-infected individuals.</ABSTRACT><URL>10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12262-6</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673698122626</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>

Recently infected patients harbored resistant variants more often than did chronically infected patients (13.5\% vs. 8.7\%; P=.006).

Drug-resistant variants are most commonly seen in patients infected with subtype B virus, probably because of longer exposure of these viruses to drugs.

However, as a result of the need for lifelong therapy and HIV's prodigious replication rate and error-prone reverse transcriptase, varying amounts of antiretroviral drug resistance are common in treated individuals. Medication adherence is linked to the development of drug resistance, although not by a simple linear relationship. Recent studies have suggested that extensive drug resistance is not a major determinant of HIV disease progression and death. Rather, failure to access care and discontinuation of or non-adherence with therapy are arguably the most important factors associated with HIV disease progression in the HAART era. Other data indicate that continued therapy in the setting of extensive drug resistance and the inability to achieve viral suppression can provide continued clinical benefit. Such benefit may be mediated, at least partially, by reductions in viral fitness associated with drug resistance mutations.</ABSTRACT><NOTES>PMID: 15722389</NOTES><URL>10.1093/jac/dki042</URL><AUTHOR_ADDRESS>http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/4/413</AUTHOR_ADDRESS></RECORD>
